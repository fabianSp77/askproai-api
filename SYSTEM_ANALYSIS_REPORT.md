# AskProAI System Analysis Report
Generated: 2025-06-20

## Executive Summary

The AskProAI system analysis reveals several critical issues that need immediate attention:

### System Status: ‚ùå CRITICAL

- **Critical Issues**: 3
- **Warnings**: 2
- **Overall Health**: Requires immediate intervention

## üö® Critical Issues

### 1. High Number of Failed Jobs (231)
The queue system has accumulated 231 failed jobs, primarily due to database schema mismatches:
- **86 failures**: Column 'retell_agent_id' not found in WHERE clause
- **73 failures**: Similar database column issues
- **Recent failures**: Missing tenant context for models

**Root Cause**: Database migrations not properly executed or schema inconsistencies

### 2. Retell.ai Integration Issues
While the API connection works (verified separately), the MCP service reports connection failures:
- API credentials are properly configured
- Agent is correctly set up (agent_9a8202a740cd3120d96fcfda1e)
- Issue appears to be with the RetellService using wrong API endpoints (v2 endpoints that don't exist)

### 3. Cal.com Integration Issues
Similar to Retell, the Cal.com integration has endpoint issues:
- API credentials are configured
- The CalcomV2Service returns data in unexpected formats
- Read-only transaction errors when trying to cache data

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### 1. Queue System (Horizon)
- Status: **RUNNING**
- Workers are active and processing jobs
- Throughput is operational

### 2. Company Configuration
- Company: AskProAI (ID: 85)
- 5 Branches configured
- 12 Customers in system
- 21 Appointments recorded
- 12 Phone numbers configured across branches

### 3. API Connections (When Tested Directly)
- **Retell.ai**: Successfully connected, 25 agents found
- **Cal.com**: API key is valid and authenticated

## üìä System Metrics

### Database Statistics
- **Branches**: 5 (2 with Cal.com event types configured)
- **Customers**: 12
- **Appointments**: 21
- **Phone Numbers**: 12

### Queue Health
- **Failed Jobs**: 231
- **Queue Status**: Running
- **Major Failure Pattern**: Database schema issues (missing columns)

## üîß Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Within 24 hours)

1. **Fix Database Schema Issues**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate:status
   php artisan migrate --force
   ```

2. **Process Failed Jobs**
   ```bash
   # After fixing schema issues
   php artisan queue:retry all
   ```

3. **Fix RetellService API Endpoints**
   - Update `/app/Services/RetellService.php` to use correct v1 endpoints
   - Already partially fixed, needs completion

4. **Fix CalcomV2Service Response Handling**
   - Ensure consistent response format across all methods
   - Fix read-only transaction issues in caching layer

### Short-term (Within 1 week)

5. **Configure Remaining Branches**
   - 3 out of 5 branches lack Cal.com event type configuration
   - Assign staff to event types

6. **Implement Monitoring**
   - Configure Sentry for error tracking
   - Set up alerts for failed job thresholds

7. **Clean Up Duplicate Data**
   - Retell agent list shows duplicates (needs deduplication)

### Medium-term (Within 1 month)

8. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Add proper tenant context middleware
   - Implement circuit breakers for external APIs

9. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement proper caching strategies
   - Optimize database queries

## üìà Key Performance Indicators

### Current State
- **Call Success Rate**: Not measurable (data issues)
- **Appointment Conversion**: Not measurable (data issues)
- **System Availability**: Partially operational

### Target State
- **Call Success Rate**: >95%
- **Appointment Conversion**: >30%
- **System Availability**: 99.9%

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Debt

1. **Mixed API Versions**: Both Cal.com v1 and v2 APIs in use
2. **Incomplete Migrations**: Several database columns missing
3. **No Monitoring**: Sentry not configured
4. **Caching Issues**: Read-only transaction conflicts

## üí° Strategic Recommendations

1. **Implement Automated Testing**
   - Add integration tests for external APIs
   - Implement health check endpoints

2. **Documentation**
   - Document API integration patterns
   - Create runbooks for common issues

3. **Deployment Process**
   - Implement proper CI/CD pipeline
   - Add migration checks before deployment

4. **Multi-tenancy Enhancement**
   - Strengthen tenant isolation
   - Add tenant context validation

## üìã Next Steps

1. Execute database migrations to fix schema issues
2. Retry all failed jobs after schema fixes
3. Complete API service fixes (RetellService and CalcomV2Service)
4. Configure monitoring (Sentry)
5. Document current system state and create operational runbooks

## üîç Analysis Details

### Failed Jobs Analysis
```
Top Failure Reasons:
1. PDOException: Column not found 'retell_agent_id' (173 jobs)
2. MissingTenantException: No company context (40+ jobs)
3. Base table or view not found (18 jobs)
```

### Integration Status
```
Retell.ai: ‚ùå (Service layer issues, API works)
Cal.com: ‚ùå (Response format issues, API works)
Sentry: ‚ö†Ô∏è (Not configured)
```

### Resource Utilization
```
Database: Operational with schema issues
Queue: Running but backlogged
Cache: Conflicts with read-only transactions
```
