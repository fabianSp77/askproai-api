# Retell.ai Export Fix Summary

## Problem
When exporting agent configurations from AskProAI for import into Retell.ai, users were getting a "reading beginn message" error. This was caused by including fields in the export that are not supported by Retell.ai's API.

## Root Cause
1. The exported JSON included a `begin_message` field, which doesn't exist in Retell.ai's API
2. The exported JSON included a `general_prompt` field at the agent level, which should be part of the LLM configuration instead
3. These fields were causing JSON parsing errors when trying to import into Retell.ai

## Solution Applied
1. Updated `sanitizeAgentForRetellExport()` method in `RetellUltimateControlCenter.php` to:
   - Remove the `begin_message` field from exports
   - Remove the `general_prompt` field from exports
   - Filter out any null or empty values to avoid parsing issues

2. Updated `RetellMCPServer.php` to remove these invalid fields from the synced_fields tracking

## Fields Now Properly Exported
The export now includes only valid Retell.ai fields such as:
- `agent_name`
- `voice_id`
- `language`
- `response_engine` (with LLM configuration)
- `webhook_url`
- `interruption_sensitivity`
- `responsiveness`
- `enable_backchannel`
- `voice_speed`
- `voice_temperature`
- And other valid Retell.ai agent properties

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Go to the Retell Ultimate Control Center
2. Select an agent and click "Export for Retell.ai"
3. The downloaded JSON should now be importable into Retell.ai without errors

## Note
The `general_prompt` and any initial message configuration should be set within the LLM configuration in Retell.ai, not at the agent level.
