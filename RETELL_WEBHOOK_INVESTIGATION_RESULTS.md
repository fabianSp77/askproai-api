# Retell Webhook Investigation Results

## Date: 2025-06-19

## Issue Summary
Retell webhooks were not being received. Calls were being registered in the database (IDs 98, 99) but without transcript/summary data, and no POST requests to webhook endpoints were visible in nginx logs.

## Root Cause Identified
**The webhook events were not configured on the Retell agent.** The `webhook_events` array was empty (`[]`), which meant Retell was not sending any webhooks despite having a webhook URL configured.

## Investigation Steps Taken

### 1. Network/Firewall Check ✅
- **UFW Status**: Allows HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) traffic
- **Nginx**: Listening correctly on ports 80 and 443  
- **Endpoint Accessibility**: Confirmed via curl test to `https://api.askproai.de/api/retell/debug-webhook`
- **Result**: No network/firewall issues blocking incoming webhooks

### 2. Webhook Configuration Check ❌
- **Initial Status**:
  ```
  Agent ID: agent_9a8202a740cd3120d96fcfda1e
  Webhook URL: https://api.askproai.de/api/retell/debug-webhook
  Webhook Events: [] ← PROBLEM: Empty array!
  ```
- **Problem**: No webhook events were enabled, so Retell wasn't sending any webhooks

### 3. Middleware/Signature Verification Check ✅
- The signature verification middleware (`VerifyRetellSignature`) has temporary bypasses for debugging
- The debug endpoint (`/api/retell/debug-webhook`) has no signature verification
- **Result**: Not the cause of the issue

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enabled Webhook Events
Ran `php enable-retell-webhook-events.php` which:
- Updated the agent to enable webhook events: `['call_started', 'call_ended', 'call_analyzed']`
- Changed webhook URL from debug endpoint to production: `https://api.askproai.de/api/retell/webhook`

### 2. Created Monitoring Script
Created `/var/www/api-gateway/monitor-webhooks.sh` to monitor:
- Nginx access logs for incoming webhook requests
- Laravel logs for webhook processing

## Next Steps

1. **Make a Test Call** to verify webhooks are now being received
2. **Run Monitoring Script**: `./monitor-webhooks.sh` to watch for webhook activity
3. **Check Logs** after test call:
   - Nginx logs: `/var/log/nginx/access.log`
   - Laravel logs: `/var/www/api-gateway/storage/logs/laravel.log`

## Additional Findings

### Retell Webhook Requirements
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds - endpoint must respond within this time
- **Retry**: Up to 3 times if no 2xx response received
- **Events**: Must be explicitly enabled via API (not just webhook URL)
- **Known IPs**: 100.20.5.228, 34.226.180.161, 34.198.47.77, 52.203.159.213, 52.53.229.199, 54.241.134.41, 54.183.150.123, 152.53.228.178

### Security Considerations
- Webhook signature verification can use the API key if no separate webhook secret is set
- The middleware has temporary debug bypasses that should be removed in production
- Always return 2xx status to prevent webhook retries even on processing errors

## Scripts Created/Used
1. `check-retell-agent-config.php` - Check current agent configuration
2. `enable-retell-webhook-events.php` - Enable webhook events on the agent
3. `update-retell-webhook-url.php` - Update webhook URL
4. `monitor-webhooks.sh` - Monitor incoming webhooks

## Conclusion
The issue was a configuration problem on the Retell side - webhook events were not enabled. This has been fixed, and webhooks should now be received when calls are made to the configured agent.
