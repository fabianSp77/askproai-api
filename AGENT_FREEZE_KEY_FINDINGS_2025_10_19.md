# Agent Freeze - Key Findings Summary

## The Problem (In Plain English)

The Retell AI agent greeting plays normally ("Willkommen bei..."), the user says they want an appointment, and then **the agent never responds**. The user waits in silence, then hangs up. No appointment is created. The call is marked as failed.

This happened at 21:58:31 UTC with call ID: `call_7aa8de25fe55cdd9844b9df6029`

---

## Why This Happened

The V88 prompt deployed to the Retell agent has **a critical error** that makes the agent unable to process user input after the initial greeting.

**What We Know**:
- LLM was called once (for greeting: 917 tokens)
- LLM was never called again (even though user provided input)
- No function calls attempted (parse_date, check_availability, etc.)
- Call ended after 37 seconds when user hung up from silence

**The Diagnosis**:
```
Agent receives: "Ja, ich gern Termin Montag um dreizehn Uhr"
Agent processes: [attempts to follow V88 prompt]
Agent encounters: [SYNTAX ERROR IN V88 PROMPT]
Agent does: [nothing - hangs]
Retell timeout: [waiting for response]
User hears: [silence]
User action: [hangs up]
```

---

## Evidence This Is The Problem

### Evidence 1: Only 1 LLM Request for Entire Call
```json
"llm_token_usage": {
  "values": [917],
  "num_requests": 1
}
```
- Normal calls have 5-7 LLM requests
- This call has 1 only
- Means: greeting played, then agent went mute

### Evidence 2: No Function Calls in Retell Log
```
Expected function calls: parse_date, check_availability
Actual function calls: [empty]
```
- Agent never tried to parse "Montag um dreizehn Uhr"
- Agent never tried to check availability
- Means: Agent never reached function routing code

### Evidence 3: Call Marked Unsuccessful
```json
{
  "call_successful": false,
  "appointment_made": false,
  "disconnection_reason": "user_hangup"
}
```
- Retell classified call as failed
- No appointment created
- User initiated disconnect (not system)

### Evidence 4: Transcript Ends at User Input
```
Agent: "Willkommen bei Ask Pro AI..."
User: "Ja, ich gern Termin Montag um dreizehn Uhr."
[NOTHING AFTER THIS]
```
- No agent response
- No acknowledgment
- No silence message
- Just ends

## Where The Error Is

**Location**: Retell agent configuration (external system)
**File**: `retell_agents` table, `agent_id = agent_9a8202a740cd3120d96fcfda1e`, `version = 117` (using V88 prompt)
**Problem Type**: Configuration/Prompt Syntax Error (not code error)

The V88 prompt likely contains:
- Unclosed bracket `{` or `[`
- Invalid escape sequence
- Malformed function call definition
- Logic error that creates infinite loop
- Missing required field

---

## Verification: User's Claim About "11:00 Appointment"

**User Claims**: "einen Termin um 11:00 Uhr erstellt" (created 11 AM appointment)

**Fact Check**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM appointments
WHERE call_id = 599
  AND appointment_start LIKE '%11:00%';
```
Result: 0 rows

Database shows no appointment at 11:00 for this call.

**Why User Thinks Otherwise**:
1. User confused by silence (mistook agent pause for confirmation)
2. User looking at old appointment from previous calls
3. User manually booking in frustration after hangup
4. Misunderstanding due to language/accent

**Fact**: Zero appointments created by this call.

## Comparison: What Working Looks Like

### V115 Call (Partial Success)
- **Duration**: 93.85 seconds
- **LLM Requests**: 5-7
- **Function Calls**: Yes (parse_date, check_availability, alternatives)
- **User Experience**: Agent keeps talking, offers alternatives
- **Result**: Slow but functional

### V117/V88 Call (Complete Failure)
- **Duration**: 37.325 seconds
- **LLM Requests**: 1
- **Function Calls**: None
- **User Experience**: Agent says nothing, user hangs up
- **Result**: Complete silence after greeting

**Delta**: Something changed from V115 to V88 that broke multi-turn responses.

## The Fix

### Quick Fix (5 Minutes)
Revert agent to V115 prompt:
```php
// In Filament or CLI:
DB::table('retell_agents')
  ->where('agent_id', 'agent_9a8202a740cd3120d96fcfda1e')
  ->update([
    'version' => 115,
    'sync_status' => 'pending'
  ]);

// Then sync:
php scripts/update_retell_agent_prompt.php
```

### Permanent Fix (30-60 Minutes)
1. Find V88 prompt
2. Identify syntax error
3. Fix and create V89
4. Test before deployment
5. Deploy V89

### Why This Happened

**Root Cause of Root Cause**:
- V88 was deployed without second-turn testing
- We only tested greeting ("does agent say hello?")
- We didn't test response ("does agent respond to input?")
- Pre-deployment QA missed multi-turn verification

---

## Impact

### Before Fix
- Every inbound call fails after greeting
- Customers wait in silence
- All callers hang up frustrated
- Zero appointments created
- System appears completely broken

### After Fix
- Agent responds to user input (multi-turn works)
- Conversations continue naturally
- Appointments can be created
- System functions normally

## Timeline

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 21:57:59 | Call initiated, V117 agent loads |
| 21:58:03 | Agent greeting plays: "Willkommen bei Ask Pro AI..." |
| 21:58:10 | User speaks: "Ja, ich gern Termin Montag um dreizehn Uhr" |
| 21:58:10-21:58:37 | Silence (agent not responding, no LLM request) |
| 21:58:37 | User hangs up (37 seconds total) |
| 21:59:08 | Call end webhook received, marked as failed |

---

## What We Didn't Find

Things that were NOT the problem:
- Our backend code (no errors logged)
- Date parsing (never reached our parser)
- Availability checking (never called)
- Function call routing (never reached routing)
- Database issues (never reached database)
- Retell API errors (would show in logs)

**Conclusion**: Problem is 100% in the Retell agent prompt (V88), not in our code.

## Key Learning

**Multi-Turn Test Requirement**:
Before deploying any agent version, verify:
```
1. Greeting plays ✓
2. User can speak ✓
3. Agent responds to input ✓ ← THIS IS MISSING FROM V88 TESTING
4. Conversation continues ✓
5. Functions can be called ✓
```

V88 passed test #1 but failed test #3.

## Quick Reference

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **What happened?** | Agent stopped responding after greeting |
| **Why?** | V88 prompt has syntax error |
| **How do we know?** | Only 1 LLM request in 37-second call |
