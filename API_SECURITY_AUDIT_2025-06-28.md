# API Security Audit Report - 2025-06-28

## Overview
This report documents the security improvements made to API endpoints to ensure proper authentication and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Protected Time Information Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `/api/zeitinfo`
- **Change**: Added `auth:sanctum` middleware
- **Reason**: Prevents unauthorized access to system time information

### 2. Metrics Endpoint Security
- **Endpoint**: `/api/metrics`
- **Status**: Already protected with `api.metrics.auth` middleware
- **Action**: Removed duplicate metrics endpoints to avoid conflicts
- **Removed**:
  - Line 195: Duplicate `/metrics` endpoint
  - Line 472: Another duplicate `/metrics` endpoint

### 3. Health Check Endpoints
Protected sensitive health check endpoints while keeping basic health checks public for monitoring tools:

#### Public (for load balancers and monitoring):
- `/api/health` - Basic ping endpoint
- `/api/health/ready` - Readiness probe
- `/api/health/live` - Liveness probe

#### Protected with `auth:sanctum`:
- `/api/health/comprehensive` - Contains detailed system information
- `/api/health/service/{service}` - Service-specific health data
- `/api/health/calcom` - Cal.com integration details
- `/api/health/detailed` - MCP detailed health information

### 4. Documentation Data API
- **Endpoints**: `/api/docs-data/*`
- **Change**: Added `auth:sanctum` middleware to entire group
- **Protected Routes**:
  - `/api/docs-data/metrics`
  - `/api/docs-data/performance`
  - `/api/docs-data/workflows`
  - `/api/docs-data/health`
- **Reason**: Prevents exposure of internal documentation and system metrics

### 5. Retell.ai Custom Function Security
Added missing signature verification to Retell custom function endpoints:

- `/api/retell/collect-appointment` - Added `verify.retell.signature`
- `/api/retell/check-transfer-availability` - Added `verify.retell.signature`
- `/api/retell/handle-urgent-transfer` - Added `verify.retell.signature`

These endpoints are called by Retell.ai during phone calls and require signature verification for security.

### 6. Test Endpoints
Verified that all test endpoints have been properly secured or removed:
- Test webhook endpoints: Already removed
- Mobile test endpoint: Already removed
- MCP test endpoints: Already removed
- Validation test endpoints: Already protected within auth:sanctum group

## Security Best Practices Applied

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only basic health checks remain public for monitoring tools
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security (auth:sanctum, signature verification, rate limiting)
3. **Consistent Security**: All sensitive data endpoints now require authentication
4. **Webhook Security**: All webhook endpoints use appropriate signature verification

## Remaining Public Endpoints

The following endpoints remain public by design:
- `/api/health` - Basic health check for load balancers
- Webhook endpoints (protected by signature verification instead of user auth)
- Cookie consent endpoints (must be accessible before authentication)

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Access**: Set up logging and alerting for unauthorized access attempts
2. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting to public endpoints
3. **API Keys**: For monitoring tools, consider using the existing `api.metrics.auth` pattern
4. **Documentation**: Update API documentation to reflect authentication requirements

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify load balancers can still access `/api/health`
- [ ] Test authenticated access to protected endpoints
- [ ] Verify Retell.ai webhooks still work with signature verification
- [ ] Confirm monitoring tools can access metrics with proper authentication
- [ ] Test that unauthorized requests receive 401 responses

## Deployment Notes

After deploying these changes:
1. Update monitoring tool configurations with authentication tokens
2. Verify webhook signatures are properly configured
3. Test all integrations to ensure they still function correctly
