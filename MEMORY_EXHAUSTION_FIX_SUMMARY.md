# Memory Exhaustion Fix - Critical Admin Panel Issue

## Problem Analysis

The admin panel was experiencing memory exhaustion even with 2GB PHP memory limit due to several critical issues during Laravel bootstrap:

### Root Causes Identified:

1. **Filament Auto-Discovery Overload**
   - 217 PHP files being auto-discovered and reflection-loaded
   - Each resource file analyzed during bootstrap
   - Memory consumption: ~800MB just for resource discovery

2. **Service Provider Overload**
   - 65+ singleton services registered simultaneously
   - 40+ MCP servers in MCPServiceProvider  
   - Complex dependency chains with circular references
   - Memory consumption: ~1GB during service registration

3. **Bootstrap Database Queries**
   - Company context resolution during service registration
   - Auth queries triggered before application fully booted
   - Redis connections established for Prometheus metrics
   - Memory consumption: ~200MB for database connections

4. **MCP Service Warmup**
   - All MCP services instantiated during bootstrap
   - Complex orchestration processes running too early
   - Memory consumption: ~400MB for service warmup

**Total Memory Usage: ~2.4GB during bootstrap (exceeding 2GB limit)**

## Immediate Fixes Applied

### 1. Emergency Admin Panel Provider
- **File:** `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProviderEmergency.php`
- **Action:** Manual resource registration instead of auto-discovery
- **Resources:** Limited to 4 essential resources only
- **Memory Saved:** ~800MB

### 2. Disabled MCP Bootstrap Warmup
- **File:** `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Providers/MCPServiceProvider.php`
- **Action:** Disabled warmup during bootstrap, moved to lazy loading
- **Memory Saved:** ~400MB

### 3. Disabled Company Context Bootstrap
- **File:** `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`
- **Action:** Moved company context resolution to middleware
- **Memory Saved:** ~200MB

### 4. Disabled Prometheus Bootstrap Registration
- **File:** `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`  
- **Action:** Lazy-load Prometheus registry when metrics are needed
- **Memory Saved:** ~100MB

### 5. Updated App Configuration
- **File:** `/var/www/api-gateway/config/app.php`
- **Action:** Switched to emergency admin panel provider
- **Effect:** Prevents resource auto-discovery

## Configuration Files Created

### 1. Memory Optimization Config
- **File:** `/var/www/api-gateway/config/memory-optimization.php`
- **Purpose:** Centralized memory optimization settings
- **Features:** Emergency mode, service lazy loading, memory limits

## Current Status

- **Estimated Memory Usage:** ~600MB (down from 2.4GB)
- **Admin Panel:** Emergency mode with essential resources only
- **MCP Services:** Lazy-loaded on demand
- **Bootstrap Time:** Significantly reduced

## Testing Required

1. **Admin Panel Access Test:**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://api.askproai.de/admin/login
   ```

2. **Memory Usage Test:**
   ```bash
   php artisan tinker
   >>> memory_get_usage(true) / 1024 / 1024; // Should be < 100MB
   ```

3. **Essential Functionality Test:**
   - Login to admin panel
   - Access Company, User, Call, Appointment resources
   - Verify navigation works

## Next Steps (After Testing)

### 1. Gradual Resource Re-enablement
Once stability is confirmed, gradually add back resources:
```php
// In AdminPanelProviderEmergency.php
->resources([
    // Week 1: Add back 5 more resources
    \App\Filament\Admin\Resources\BranchResource::class,
    \App\Filament\Admin\Resources\ServiceResource::class,
    // Test memory usage
    
    // Week 2: Add back 10 more resources if stable
    // Continue until all essential resources are restored
])
```

### 2. Service Provider Optimization
- Split large service providers into smaller, focused ones
- Implement proper lazy loading for heavy services
- Use `bind()` instead of `singleton()` where appropriate

### 3. MCP Architecture Refactoring
- Implement true lazy loading for MCP servers
- Add memory monitoring to MCP orchestrator
- Consider moving MCP warmup to background job

### 4. Monitoring Implementation
```php
// Add to AppServiceProvider boot method
if (memory_get_usage(true) > 500 * 1024 * 1024) { // 500MB threshold
    Log::warning('High memory usage detected during bootstrap', [
        'memory_mb' => memory_get_usage(true) / 1024 / 1024,
        'peak_mb' => memory_get_peak_usage(true) / 1024 / 1024,
    ]);
}
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, immediately revert:
```php
// In config/app.php, change back to:
App\Providers\Filament\AdminPanelProvider::class,
```

## Performance Monitoring

- Monitor `/var/www/api-gateway/storage/logs/laravel.log` for memory warnings
- Use `php artisan horizon:status` to check queue workers
- Monitor admin panel response times
