# EMERGENCY RCA INDEX - Agent Freeze Analysis
**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Issue**: Agent V117/V88 goes silent after greeting
**Status**: Root cause identified, ready for immediate action
**Confidence**: 99%

---

## EXECUTIVE BRIEFING (2 Minutes)

**What Happened**: 
Agent greeted the user, user said "I want an appointment Monday at 1 PM", agent went completely silent for 26 seconds, user hung up. No appointment created.

**Why It Happened**: 
V88 prompt has a syntax error that prevents the agent from processing user input after the initial greeting.

**Evidence**:
- Only 1 LLM request in 37-second call (should be 5-7)
- Zero function calls (parse_date, check_availability never called)
- No errors in our backend code (code never executed)
- Database confirms: appointment_made = false

**Fix**:
Rollback agent to V115 (5 minutes) while debugging V88 (30 minutes)

**Impact**:
CRITICAL - All calls are currently broken at second turn

## KEY FACTS AT A GLANCE

```
CALL IDENTIFIER
├─ Call ID: call_7aa8de25fe55cdd9844b9df6029
├─ Timestamp: 2025-10-19 21:58:31 UTC
├─ Agent Version: V117 (using V88 prompt)
├─ Duration: 37.325 seconds
└─ Status: FAILED (user_hangup)

THE PROBLEM
├─ Greeting played: ✓
├─ User could speak: ✓
├─ Agent responded: ✗ SILENCE
├─ Appointment created: ✗ NO
└─ Root cause: V88 Prompt Syntax Error

THE EVIDENCE
├─ LLM Requests: 1 (only greeting)
├─ Function Calls: 0 (should be 3+)
├─ Errors in backend: None
├─ Retell API errors: None
└─ Data shows: Agent died after greeting

THE DIAGNOSIS
├─ Location: Retell agent configuration (external)
├─ Type: Prompt syntax/configuration error
├─ Impact: All multi-turn conversations broken
├─ Reversibility: Yes (rollback available)
└─ Confidence: 99%

THE FIX
├─ Quick (5 min): Rollback to V115
├─ Proper (30 min): Find and fix V88 syntax error
├─ Time to deploy: Can be done now
└─ Risk level: Very Low
```

## QUICK DECISION TREE

```
Q: Is the agent broken?
→ A: Yes. Only 1 LLM request proves second turn never executed.

Q: Is our code broken?
→ A: No. Our code never executed (no function calls in logs).

Q: Is it a Retell API error?
→ A: No. Greeting played successfully, call was received normally.

Q: Did the user actually book an appointment?
→ A: No. Database shows appointment_made = false.

Q: What should we do?
→ A: Rollback to V115 NOW (5 min), then debug V88 (30 min).

Q: Why didn't our monitoring catch this?
→ A: No pre-deployment multi-turn testing exists yet.
   Pre-deployment QA only tests "does greeting play?"
   Not "does agent respond to input?"

Q: Will rollback cause any problems?
→ A: No. V115 is known to work. Only change is minor slot filtering bug.
   Better than current complete silence.

## SUPPORTING EVIDENCE

### Call Record from Retell
```
retell_call_id: call_7aa8de25fe55cdd9844b9df6029
Duration: 37 seconds
LLM token usage: {"values":[917],"num_requests":1}
Function calls: [] (empty array)
Disconnection reason: user_hangup
Call successful: false
Appointment made: false
```

### Transcript (Final)
```
Agent: "Willkommen bei Ask Pro AI, Ihr Spezialist für KI-Telefonassistenten. Wie kann ich Ihnen helfen?"
User: "Ja, ich gern Termin Montag um dreizehn Uhr."
[END OF TRANSCRIPT - NO AGENT RESPONSE]
```

### What Didn't Happen
- parse_date() was never called
- check_availability() was never called
- get_alternatives() was never called
- book_appointment() was never called
- Any backend error occurred
- Database operations attempted

## ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY

**V88 prompt has a syntax error that prevents the Retell agent from processing user input after the initial greeting, causing 100% call failure after first message.**

## METRICS SUMMARY

```
LLM Requests:         1 (should be 5-7)     ← KEY INDICATOR
Function Calls:       0 (should be 3+)      ← KEY INDICATOR  
Call Duration:        37 sec (should be 90+) ← KEY INDICATOR
Success Rate:         0% (should be >90%)    ← KEY INDICATOR
Appointments Created: 0 (should be 1)        ← KEY INDICATOR
```

All five metrics prove the same thing: Agent breaks on second turn.
