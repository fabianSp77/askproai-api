# Testing Progress Report - AskProAI

## Executive Summary

We have successfully increased the test count from **31 to 40+ functioning tests** through systematic fixes and test activation. The main challenge is that most tests require database connections which are failing with QueryException errors in the test environment.

## Current Test Statistics

### Working Test Suites (40 tests total)

1. **Unit Tests**
   - `DashboardMetricsServiceTest`: 8/8 tests passing âœ…
   - `WebhookDeduplicationServiceTest`: 11/11 tests passing âœ…
   - `MockServicesTest`: 5/5 tests passing âœ…
   - `DatabaseConnectionTest`: 2/2 tests passing âœ…
   - `SensitiveDataMaskerTest`: 8/9 tests passing âœ…

2. **Feature Tests**
   - `SimpleTest`: 2/2 tests passing âœ…
   - `CriticalFixesTest`: 4/6 tests passing âœ…

### Key Fixes Implemented

1. **Call Model Relationship Fix**
   - Changed `appointment()` relationship from `BelongsTo` to `HasOne`
   - This fixed the success rate calculation in DashboardMetricsServiceTest

2. **TenantScope Handling**
   - Used `withoutGlobalScope(\App\Scopes\TenantScope::class)` for models with manual scope application
   - Used `forCompany()` method for models with BelongsToCompany trait

3. **SQLite Compatibility**
   - Added database driver detection
   - Used `json_extract()` for SQLite instead of `whereJsonContains()`

4. **Float Comparison Fixes**
   - Replaced `assertEquals` with `assertEqualsWithDelta` for percentage calculations
   - Used appropriate delta tolerances (0.01 to 0.1)

## Major Blockers

### 1. Database Connection Issues
Most tests are failing with QueryException due to:
- Missing database tables in test environment
- Schema mismatches between migrations and test expectations
- Test database not properly configured for all table structures

### 2. Factory Dependencies
Many tests require factories that either:
- Don't exist (e.g., PortalUserFactory)
- Have missing required fields
- Reference non-existent relationships

### 3. External Service Dependencies
Tests that require external services fail:
- Cal.com API integration tests
- Retell.ai webhook tests
- Stripe payment tests

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Quick Wins)

1. **Create Pure Unit Tests**
   - Focus on helper functions and utilities
   - Create tests for data transformation methods
   - Test validation logic without database

2. **Fix Simple Test Issues**
   - Add missing imports (like Cache facade)
   - Fix type hints and property declarations
   - Update deprecated PHPUnit attributes

3. **Mock External Services**
   - Create comprehensive mocks for Cal.com, Retell.ai, Stripe
   - Use test doubles for database operations
   - Implement in-memory repositories for testing

### Long-term Solutions

1. **Test Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create proper test database
   php artisan migrate:fresh --env=testing
   
   # Install PCOV for code coverage
   pecl install pcov
   
   # Configure phpunit.xml for SQLite in-memory DB
   ```

2. **Factory Creation Sprint**
   - Create missing factories for all models
   - Ensure factories have all required fields
   - Create factory states for different scenarios

3. **Test Infrastructure Improvements**
   - Implement TestCase helpers for common operations
   - Create trait for API testing with proper auth
   - Add database seeders for test scenarios

## Code Coverage Analysis

### Current Coverage (Estimated)
- **Controllers**: ~5%
- **Services**: ~15%
- **Models**: ~10%
- **Helpers**: ~20%
- **Overall**: ~12%

### Target Coverage
- **Phase 1** (Current): 15% coverage with 50+ tests
- **Phase 2** (Next Sprint): 30% coverage with 150+ tests
- **Phase 3** (Q2 2025): 50% coverage with 300+ tests
- **Phase 4** (Q3 2025): 70% coverage with 500+ tests

## Test Execution Performance

- **Current Suite**: ~4 seconds for 40 tests
- **Average per test**: 100ms
- **Slowest test**: DashboardMetricsServiceTest (3.8s)
- **Fastest tests**: Mock-based tests (<50ms)

## Next Steps Priority Queue

1. **Fix SensitiveDataMaskerTest exception test** (1 test)
2. **Create 10 simple helper function tests** (10 tests)
3. **Fix CriticalFixesTest remaining 2 tests** (2 tests)
4. **Create mock-based service tests** (20+ tests)
5. **Fix authentication test issues** (10+ tests)

## Success Metrics

âœ… **Achieved**:
- Increased test count by 29%
- Fixed critical dashboard metrics calculations
- Established testing patterns for multi-tenant apps
- Created comprehensive test documentation

ðŸŽ¯ **Target for Next Iteration**:
- Reach 100+ functioning tests
- Achieve 25% code coverage
- Reduce average test execution time to <50ms
- Zero flaky tests

## Conclusion

While we haven't reached the ambitious goal of 250+ tests, we've made significant progress in understanding the test infrastructure challenges and establishing patterns for future test development. The main bottleneck is the database layer, which requires a dedicated effort to resolve.

The focus should shift from quantity to quality - ensuring we have a solid foundation of working tests that can be built upon systematically.
