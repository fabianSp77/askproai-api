# Staging Database Quick Fix

**For the Impatient**: Execute this now, read details later.

---

## TL;DR

Staging DB only has 48 tables, needs 244. Migration failed on duplicate column. Fix it:

```bash
# Go to project root
cd /var/www/api-gateway

# Run the automated fix script
bash scripts/fix-staging-database.sh

# Done! Takes ~15 minutes
```

That's it. Script handles everything automatically.

---

## What This Does

1. ✓ Backs up current staging DB
2. ✓ Drops and recreates staging DB fresh
3. ✓ Runs all 138 migrations
4. ✓ Verifies schema matches production (244 tables)
5. ✓ Clears caches
6. ✓ Shows you the results

## Troubleshooting

**Script failed?**

Check these in order:

```bash
# 1. Verify MySQL credentials work
mysql -u root -e "SHOW DATABASES;"

# 2. Check .env.staging exists and is readable
cat .env.staging | grep DB_

# 3. Check if Laravel is broken
php artisan --version

# 4. Read the migration log
cat backups/migration_*.log | tail -50
```

**Still stuck?**

Manual approach:

```bash
# Backup
mysqldump -u askproai_staging_user -p'St4g1ng_S3cur3_P@ssw0rd_2025' \
  askproai_staging > /tmp/staging_backup.sql

# Drop & Recreate
mysql -u root -e "
  DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS askproai_staging;
  CREATE DATABASE askproai_staging CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON askproai_staging.* TO 'askproai_staging_user'@'localhost';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
"

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate --env=staging --force

# Verify
mysql -u askproai_staging_user -p'St4g1ng_S3cur3_P@ssw0rd_2025' \
  -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA='askproai_staging';"
```

Should output: `244` (or close to it)

## What Changed

**Before**: 48 tables (19% complete)
- No Retell tables
- No conversation flows
- No advanced notifications
- No data consistency infrastructure

**After**: 244 tables (100% complete)
- All Retell voice AI tables
- Conversation flow management
- Advanced notification system
- Data consistency infrastructure
- Everything production has

---

## Critical Tables Added

```
✓ retell_call_sessions      - Track voice calls
✓ retell_call_events        - Call events
✓ retell_transcript_segments - Call transcripts
✓ conversation_flows         - Agent flows
✓ data_flow_logs            - Data consistency
✓ notification_*            - Notification system
✓ And 197 more...
```

## Backup Safety

Your backup is here:
```
/var/www/api-gateway/backups/staging_backup_*.sql
```

If anything breaks:
```bash
# Restore from backup
mysql -u root < /var/www/api-gateway/backups/staging_backup_TIMESTAMP.sql
```

---

## Time Investment

- **Automatic fix**: ~15 minutes (mostly waiting)
- **Manual fix**: ~30 minutes
- **Reading full docs**: ~45 minutes
- **Doing nothing**: ∞ (staging stays broken)

---

## Next: Test Customer Portal

Once script completes successfully:

```bash
# 1. Test database is alive
php artisan tinker --env=staging
>>> DB::connection('staging')->table('appointments')->count();
# Should return a number, not error

# 2. Check specific Customer Portal tables
>>> DB::connection('staging')->table('retell_call_sessions')->count();
# Should work

# 3. Run a quick test
php artisan test --env=staging tests/Feature/CustomerPortal/ --stop-on-failure

# 4. Visit it in browser
# https://staging.askproai.de
```

## The Problem (If You Care)

Migration `2025_10_23_162250` tried to add a `priority` column to `services` table, but it already existed. Laravel stopped processing migrations after that. Result: Only 48 tables created instead of 244.

Solution: Start fresh from scratch (the fastest, safest way).
