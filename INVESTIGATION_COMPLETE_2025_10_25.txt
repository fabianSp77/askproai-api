ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS - COMPLETE
================================================================================

ISSUE: Date Mismatch in Availability Check
- User requested: Saturday 25.10.2025 at 15:00 Uhr
- System offered: Monday 27.10.2025 (2-day shift)
- Expected: Clear message "Saturday closed" + logical alternatives

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: /var/www/api-gateway/app/Services/AppointmentAlternativeFinder.php
- Method: findNextWorkdayAlternatives() (lines 251-302)
- Problem: Called getNextWorkday(Saturday) which returns Monday (+2 days)
- Bug: No check to prevent NEXT_WORKDAY strategy for weekend dates

THE FIX: 
- File: /var/www/api-gateway/app/Services/AppointmentAlternativeFinder.php
- Added: Conditional check at lines 265-275
- Logic: Skip NEXT_WORKDAY strategy if desired date is NOT a workday
- Impact: Weekend requests now skip directly to NEXT_WEEK/NEXT_AVAILABLE
