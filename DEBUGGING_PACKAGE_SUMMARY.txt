THE 4 BUGS BEING INVESTIGATED
================================================================================

BUG #1: Agent Hallucination (Service Selection Mismatch)
--------
Symptom:    AI suggests services that don't exist in the system
Impact:     Booking failures, user confusion
Status:     Information gathering phase
Priority:   #4 (address after other bugs)
Est. Fix:   45 minutes
Key File:   app/Services/Retell/ServiceSelectionService.php

Critical Questions to Answer:
✓ Where is Retell conversation flow stored? (Dashboard/JSON/Database)
✓ How to update conversation flow? (API/Artisan command/Script)
✓ Can we test flow changes locally? (Simulator/Mock/Test calls)
✓ How are function results passed to conversation flow?
✓ What's the exact condition syntax for flow transitions?

BUG #2: Date Parsing Errors
--------
Symptom:    Incorrect date interpretation from user input
Impact:     Wrong appointments created, parsing failures
Status:     Well-documented service - HIGH CONFIDENCE DIAGNOSIS
Priority:   #2 (address after V9 deployment)
Est. Fix:   15 minutes
Key File:   app/Services/Retell/DateTimeParser.php (945 lines)

What We Already Know:
✓ DateTimeParser has 10+ public methods
✓ German relative dates fully supported ('heute', 'morgen', 'dieser Donnerstag')
✓ Multiple input formats supported (ISO, German, German short)
✓ Comprehensive test file exists and can be run
✓ Timezone handling: Europe/Berlin with smart request-scoped caching

Next Step: Run tests to identify specific failure case

BUG #3: Email Crash (ICS Attachment)
--------
Symptom:    Email notifications fail when attaching calendar
Impact:     Users don't receive booking confirmations
Status:     Likely quick fix - library version or code issue
Priority:   #3 (address after date parsing)
Est. Fix:   30 minutes
Key File:   [Notification class - location TBD]

What We Already Know:
✓ ICS library: spatie/icalendar-generator v3.0 installed
✓ Mail configuration files exist (config/mail.php)
✓ Library is in vendor/ directory

Next Steps:
✓ Find notification class sending ICS (grep search needed)
✓ Check error logs
✓ Update library OR disable ICS temporarily

BUG #4: V9 Not Deployed (Cache/Version Issue) - HIGHEST PRIORITY
--------
Symptom:    Code changes not reflected in running system despite commits
Impact:     V9 fixes exist but not active - blocks other bug fixes
Status:     Deployment verification needed - CRITICAL
Priority:   #1 (FIX FIRST - takes only 5 minutes)
Est. Fix:   5 minutes (just clear caches + restart)
Key File:   All service files - verify they're loaded

Root Cause Possibilities:
✓ V9 commit not in current branch (deploy missing code)
✓ OPcache caching old bytecode (clear cache)
✓ Code modified but not committed (stash or commit)
✓ PHP-FPM not restarted (reload services)

Quick Fix Sequence:
1. git pull (ensure V9 is deployed)
2. php artisan optimize:clear (clear all caches)
3. sudo systemctl restart php-fpm (restart web server)
4. Verify: git log --oneline -1 (should show V9 commit)
