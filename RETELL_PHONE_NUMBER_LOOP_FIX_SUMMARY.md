# Retell Phone Number Collection Loop Fix - Summary

## Problem
The Retell AI agent was stuck in a loop asking for the customer's phone number, even though it already had access to the caller's phone number through the call context.

## Root Causes
1. The custom functions were not configured to use the caller's phone number by default
2. The agent prompt instructed to collect phone numbers explicitly
3. The `check_customer` function wasn't using the caller's phone number automatically
4. Missing `current_time_berlin` function referenced in the agent configuration

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated RetellCustomFunctionsController
- **check_customer**: Now automatically uses caller's phone number from multiple possible fields
- **collect_appointment**: Enhanced to use caller's phone number if not explicitly provided
- **current_time_berlin**: Added missing function to provide current time in Berlin timezone
- **bookAppointmentSimple**: New simplified booking method that handles everything in one call

### 2. Added Routes
All custom functions are now properly routed in `/routes/retell-test.php`:
- `/retell/functions/check-customer`
- `/retell/functions/collect-appointment`
- `/retell/functions/check-availability`
- `/retell/functions/book-appointment`
- `/retell/functions/cancel-appointment`
- `/retell/functions/reschedule-appointment`
- `/retell/functions/current-time-berlin`
- `/retell/functions/book-simple`

### 3. Created Fixed Agent Prompt Template
File: `RETELL_AGENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE_FIXED.md`

Key improvements:
- **NEVER** asks for phone number - uses `{{caller_phone_number}}` automatically
- Clear linear booking flow
- Automatic customer check on call start
- Structured conversation phases with time estimates

### 4. Updated Custom Functions Configuration
File: `retell-custom-functions-fixed.json`

Key changes:
- All phone number parameters default to `{{caller_phone_number}}`
- Added `current_time_berlin` function
- Clear parameter descriptions
- Proper response field definitions

## How to Apply the Fix

### 1. Update Retell Agent Configuration
In the Retell.ai dashboard:
1. Go to your agent configuration
2. Update the LLM prompt with the content from `RETELL_AGENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE_FIXED.md`
3. Update custom functions with the configuration from `retell-custom-functions-fixed.json`

### 2. Test the Fixed Flow
1. Make a test call to the agent
2. The flow should be:
   - Agent greets and automatically checks if you're an existing customer
   - Asks what service you need
   - Asks for preferred date and time
   - Confirms availability
   - Books the appointment without asking for phone number

### 3. Monitor Logs
Check logs for proper flow:
```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -E "check_customer|collect_appointment|caller_number"
```

## Key Points to Remember

1. **Phone Number Handling**:
   - Always use `{{caller_phone_number}}` in custom function calls
   - Never ask the customer for their phone number unless they want to use a different one
   - The phone number is automatically available from the call context

2. **Linear Booking Flow**:
   - Greet → Check Customer → Get Service → Get Date/Time → Check Availability → Book → Confirm
   - Each step should flow naturally without loops

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If company can't be resolved from phone number, provide helpful error message
   - Log all steps for debugging
   - Graceful fallbacks for system errors

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Agent does NOT ask for phone number
- [ ] Customer check happens automatically after greeting
- [ ] Booking flow is linear without loops
- [ ] Appointment gets created with correct phone number
- [ ] Confirmation message includes all details
- [ ] SMS/Email confirmation is sent (if configured)

## Troubleshooting

If the agent still asks for phone number:
1. Verify the LLM prompt was updated correctly
2. Check that custom functions have `{{caller_phone_number}}` as default
3. Ensure the agent configuration was saved and published
4. Check logs to see what phone number value is being passed

If booking fails:
1. Check if company can be resolved from the calling phone number
2. Verify the phone number format (should include country code)
3. Check MCP server logs for detailed error messages
4. Ensure all required services are running (Horizon, etc.)
