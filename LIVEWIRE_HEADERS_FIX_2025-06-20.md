# Livewire Headers Error Fix - 2025-06-20

## Problem
When Livewire performs redirects, it returns a `Livewire\Features\SupportRedirects\Redirector` object instead of a standard HTTP Response object. Multiple middleware were trying to access the `->headers` property on this Redirector object, causing the error:

```
Undefined property: Livewire\Features\SupportRedirects\Redirector::$headers
```

## Root Cause
The middleware were expecting all responses to be standard Symfony/Laravel Response objects with a `headers` property, but Livewire uses its own Redirector class for handling redirects which doesn't have this property.

## Fixed Files

### 1. Global Middleware (Active in Kernel.php)
- **MonitoringMiddleware.php** - Fixed `addSecurityHeaders()` method and removed Response type hint
- **EnsureTenantContext.php** - Removed Response type hint from handle method
- **ThreatDetectionMiddleware.php** - Fixed `addSecurityHeaders()` method and removed Response type hint
- **CorrelationIdMiddleware.php** - Added check before accessing headers

### 2. Debug Middleware (May be temporarily active)
- **LivewireDebugMiddleware.php** - Added method_exists checks before accessing response methods
- **DebugRedirects.php** - Added method_exists checks for getStatusCode and headers
- **SessionManager.php** - Added type checking before calling ensureSessionCookieSettings
- **LogPageErrors.php** - Added method_exists checks for getStatusCode and getContent

### 3. Other Fixes
- **EventTypeImportWizard.php** - Added method_exists check for headers() method on HTTP response

## Solution Pattern
The fix follows this pattern:

```php
// Before
$response->headers->set('X-Header', 'value');

// After
if (method_exists($response, 'headers') || property_exists($response, 'headers')) {
    $response->headers->set('X-Header', 'value');
}
```

## Type Hint Removal
Removed strict Response type hints from middleware handle methods:

```php
// Before
public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next): Response

// After  
public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
```

## Testing
After applying these fixes:
1. Clear all caches: `php artisan optimize:clear`
2. Test Livewire pages that perform redirects
3. Monitor logs for any remaining header-related errors

## Prevention
For future middleware development:
1. Don't assume response objects always have a `headers` property
2. Use duck typing and check for method/property existence
3. Avoid strict Response type hints in middleware that might handle Livewire responses
4. Test middleware with both standard HTTP responses and Livewire redirects
