# Retell Ultimate Dashboard - 500 Error Fix

## Problem
When selecting an agent in the Retell Ultimate Dashboard, users were getting a 500 Internal Server Error.

## Root Cause
The issue was that the `$this->service` property (RetellV2Service instance) was not being persisted between Livewire requests. When `selectAgent()` was called via `wire:click`, the service was null, causing:
```
Call to a member function listAgents() on null
```

## Solution
Added service initialization checks to all methods that use the service:

1. **Created `initializeService()` method** - Centralizes the service initialization logic
2. **Updated `selectAgent()`** - Added check to ensure service is initialized before use
3. **Updated `loadLLMData()`** - Added service initialization check
4. **Updated `savePrompt()`** - Added service initialization check

### Key Changes:
```php
// Before
public function selectAgent($agentId): void
{
    $agentsResult = $this->service->listAgents(); // $this->service was null
}

// After
public function selectAgent($agentId): void
{
    // Ensure service is initialized
    if (!$this->service) {
        $this->initializeService();
        if (!$this->service) {
            $this->error = 'Failed to initialize Retell service';
            return;
        }
    }
    
    $agentsResult = $this->service->listAgents(); // Now works!
}
```

## Why This Happens in Livewire
Livewire components are stateless between requests. Properties that are not public or are not primitive types (like service instances) are not persisted between requests. Each Livewire request creates a new component instance, so we need to reinitialize services as needed.

## Result
✅ Dashboard now works correctly
✅ Agent selection works without errors
✅ All 4 functions display with correct details
✅ Function parameters show correctly
