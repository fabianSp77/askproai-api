# Authorization Security Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-06-28

## Problem Identified
All Filament resources had overly permissive authorization methods that returned `true` for all users, bypassing proper permission checks. This created a serious security vulnerability where any authenticated user could access and modify any resource.

## Files Fixed

### 1. **CompanyResource.php**
- **Path**: `/app/Filament/Admin/Resources/CompanyResource.php`
- **Changes**:
  - `canViewAny()`: Now checks for `super_admin` role or `view_any_company` permission
  - `canView()`: Checks for `super_admin`, `view_company` permission, or if user belongs to the company
  - `canEdit()`: Checks for `super_admin`, `update_company` permission, or if user is a `company_admin` of their own company
  - `canCreate()`: Only allows `super_admin` or users with `create_company` permission

### 2. **StaffResource.php**
- **Path**: `/app/Filament/Admin/Resources/StaffResource.php`
- **Changes**:
  - `canViewAny()`: Checks for `super_admin`, `view_any_staff` permission, or any company user
  - `canView()`: Ensures users can only view staff from their own company
  - `canEdit()`: Restricts to `super_admin`, users with permission, or `company_admin`/`branch_manager` of the same company
  - `canCreate()`: Allows `company_admin` and `branch_manager` to create staff

### 3. **BranchResource.php**
- **Path**: `/app/Filament/Admin/Resources/BranchResource.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Similar pattern to StaffResource
  - Company users can view branches from their company
  - Only `company_admin` can edit/create branches for their company

### 4. **CustomerResource.php**
- **Path**: `/app/Filament/Admin/Resources/CustomerResource.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Any company user can view/create customers
  - Multi-tenant isolation ensures users only see customers from their company

### 5. **ServiceResource.php**
- **Path**: `/app/Filament/Admin/Resources/ServiceResource.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Company users can view services
  - `company_admin` and `branch_manager` can manage services

### 6. **PhoneNumberResource.php**
- **Path**: `/app/Filament/Admin/Resources/PhoneNumberResource.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Restricted to `company_admin` role
  - Ensures phone numbers are only accessible by company admins

### 7. **AppointmentResource.php**
- **Path**: `/app/Filament/Admin/Resources/AppointmentResource.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Any company user can view/create appointments
  - Multi-tenant isolation enforced

### 8. **InvoiceResource.php**
- **Path**: `/app/Filament/Admin/Resources/InvoiceResource.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Restricted to `company_admin` and `accountant` roles
  - Edit permission only for draft invoices
  - Financial data properly protected

## Role Structure Created

### Roles and Permissions Seeder
- **Path**: `/database/seeders/RolesAndPermissionsSeeder.php`
- **Roles Created**:

1. **super_admin**: Full system access
2. **company_admin**: Full access within their company
3. **branch_manager**: Can manage their branch
4. **staff**: Basic operational access
5. **accountant**: Financial data access
6. **customer**: Portal access only
7. **reseller**: Can manage multiple companies

## Security Improvements

1. **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: All resources now properly check `company_id` to ensure data isolation
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Proper permission checks using Spatie Laravel Permission
3. **Granular Permissions**: Specific permissions for each action on each resource
4. **Hierarchical Access**: Clear hierarchy from super_admin → company_admin → branch_manager → staff
5. **Financial Protection**: Invoice access restricted to authorized roles only

## Implementation Notes

1. The `Gate::before()` in `AuthServiceProvider.php` ensures super_admin users bypass all checks
2. Each resource method now has defensive checks with multiple authorization layers
3. The authorization follows the principle of least privilege
4. Multi-tenant scoping is preserved alongside authorization checks

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Run the seeder**: `php artisan db:seed --class=RolesAndPermissionsSeeder`
2. **Assign roles to existing users**
3. **Test each resource with different user roles**
4. **Verify multi-tenant isolation is maintained**
5. **Check that super_admin can still access everything**

## Additional Security Considerations

1. Consider implementing audit logging for sensitive operations
2. Add rate limiting for API endpoints
3. Implement IP whitelisting for admin access
4. Regular permission audits
5. Two-factor authentication for admin users

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the previous "return true;" implementations can be temporarily restored, but this should only be done in emergency situations as it creates a significant security vulnerability.
