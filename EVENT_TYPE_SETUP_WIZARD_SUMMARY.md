# Event Type Setup Wizard - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Event Type Setup Wizard has been successfully implemented with significant UI/UX improvements to address user confusion about data sources and improve visual clarity.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Data Flow Clarification

### 2. UI/UX Enhancements

#### Visual Hierarchy
- Added custom CSS for better spacing between form fields
- Implemented responsive grid layouts for help sections

## Data Flow Explanation

```

   ↓ Query with Company Filter
3. Event Type Setup Wizard
   - Display local copies
   - Allow configuration of syncable fields
   - Provide links for Cal.com-only settings
```

## Testing Results

✅ **All tests passing:**
