## üî• Quick Start

!!! tip "Only 2 Configurations Needed!"
    1. Set `branches.calcom_event_type_id` 
    2. Set `phone_numbers.retell_agent_id`
    
    That's it! The system handles everything else automatically.

### Minimal Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/askproai/api-gateway.git
    cd api-gateway
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    composer install
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure environment**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

4. **Run migrations**
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed
    ```

5. **Configure the 2 critical values**
    ```sql
    -- Set Cal.com Event Type
    UPDATE branches SET calcom_event_type_id = YOUR_EVENT_TYPE_ID WHERE id = 1;
    
    -- Set Retell Agent
    UPDATE phone_numbers SET retell_agent_id = 'YOUR_AGENT_ID' WHERE number = '+YOUR_PHONE';
    ```

6. **Start the services**
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    php artisan horizon
    npm run dev
    ```
