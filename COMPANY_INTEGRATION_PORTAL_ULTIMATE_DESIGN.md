# Company Integration Portal - Ultimate Design Implementation

## Overview

I've created the ultimate Company Integration Portal design that combines modern UI/UX patterns with full functionality preservation. The design follows best practices from leading admin dashboards (Stripe, Vercel, Linear) while maintaining all complex features.

## Key Design Principles

### 1. **Visual Hierarchy & Information Architecture**
- **Glassmorphism Header**: Premium feel with blurred backgrounds and gradient overlays
- **Live Status Indicators**: Real-time pulsing animations for connection status
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features hidden behind expandable sections
- **Card-Based Layout**: Each integration and branch in its own visual container

### 2. **Modern Aesthetics**
- **Gradient Accents**: Subtle gradients for depth and visual interest
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions and Alpine.js powered interactions
- **Dark Mode Support**: Full dark mode with proper contrast ratios
- **Responsive Grid System**: Adapts from mobile to ultra-wide displays

### 3. **Preserved Functionality**
All existing features are preserved:
- ✅ Inline editing of company settings
