# Emergency Fix Summary - Livewire 500 Error

## Issue
Customer view page (and similar Filament resource pages) returned **HTTP 500** on any request.

## Root Cause
PHP namespace resolution error in method return type annotation:
```
Error: class App\Filament\Resources\CustomerResource\Pages\Model is not available
```

The `resolveRecord()` method had bare type `Model` instead of fully qualified `\Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model`.

## Solution
Changed in 5 files - all `resolveRecord()` methods:

**BEFORE** (Broken):
```php
protected function resolveRecord($key): Model
```

**AFTER** (Fixed):
```php
protected function resolveRecord($key): \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model
```

## Files Modified
- `app/Filament/Resources/CustomerResource/Pages/ViewCustomer.php`
- `app/Filament/Resources/CallResource/Pages/ViewCall.php`
- `app/Filament/Resources/BranchResource/Pages/ViewBranch.php`
- `app/Filament/Resources/PhoneNumberResource/Pages/ViewPhoneNumber.php`
- `app/Filament/Resources/PhoneNumberResource/Pages/EditPhoneNumber.php`

## Commits
- `5b4ba044`: Initial fix
- `cc2770d5`: Extended fix to all resource pages

## Status
✓ **RESOLVED** - All customer view pages now functional
✓ No new errors in production logs
✓ Full verification completed

## Time to Fix
- Diagnosis: 15 minutes (found in nginx error.log)
- Implementation: 5 minutes (5 files updated)
- Verification: 10 minutes (Reflection API + log analysis)

## Key Insight
PHP's method compatibility check requires **fully qualified return types** when overriding parent methods. Bare type names are resolved relative to the current namespace, which caused a false class reference and compatibility failure.
