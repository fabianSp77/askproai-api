# Event-Driven Architecture Complete - 2025-08-01

## Phase 2.2: Implement event-driven architecture âœ…

### Completed Implementation

#### 1. Created EventMCPServer
- **File**: `app/Services/MCP/EventMCPServer.php`
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive event management system
  - Event logging with audit trail
  - Event replay capability
  - Event subscriptions and webhooks
  - Custom event definitions
  - Event timeline tracking
  - Statistics and analytics

#### 2. Event System Database Schema
- **Migration**: `database/migrations/2025_08_01_create_event_system_tables.php`
- **Tables**:
  - `event_logs` - Stores all business events
  - `event_subscriptions` - Webhook subscriptions
  - `custom_events` - User-defined events
  - `event_audit_trail` - Compliance tracking

- **Migration**: `database/migrations/2025_08_01_create_webhook_logs_table.php`
- **Table**:
  - `webhook_logs` - Tracks webhook calls and responses

#### 3. Event Listener System
- **EventLogger**: `app/Listeners/EventLogger.php`
  - Automatically logs all business events
  - Integrates with existing Laravel events
  - Triggers webhooks for subscriptions
  - Maintains audit trail

#### 4. Webhook System
- **TriggerEventWebhooks**: `app/Jobs/TriggerEventWebhooks.php`
  - Processes event subscriptions
  - Applies filters to events
  - Queues webhook calls

- **CallWebhook**: `app/Jobs/CallWebhook.php`
  - Handles individual webhook calls
  - Implements retry logic with backoff
  - Logs webhook responses
  - Disables failing subscriptions

#### 5. API Controller
- **EventsApiController**: `app/Http/Controllers/Portal/Api/EventsApiController.php`
- **Endpoints**:
  - GET `/events` - Query event history
  - GET `/events/timeline` - Entity event timeline
  - GET `/events/stats` - Event statistics
  - GET `/events/schemas` - Available event schemas
  - GET `/events/subscriptions` - List subscriptions
  - POST `/events/subscriptions` - Create subscription
  - PUT `/events/subscriptions/{id}` - Update subscription
  - DELETE `/events/subscriptions/{id}` - Delete subscription
  - GET `/events/webhook-logs` - View webhook logs
  - POST `/events/test-webhook` - Test webhook endpoint

#### 6. React UI Component
- **File**: `resources/js/Pages/Portal/Events/Index.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - Event history viewer with filters
  - Event statistics dashboard
  - Webhook subscription management
  - Webhook testing interface
  - Webhook logs viewer
  - Event detail drawer

#### 7. Routes Configuration
- **File**: `routes/api-portal.php`
- Added comprehensive event management routes
- Integrated with portal authentication

#### 8. Service Provider Updates
- **EventServiceProvider**: Added EventLogger subscriber
- **MCPServiceProvider**: Registered EventMCPServer

### Event Types Tracked

#### Standard Events
- `appointment.created`
- `appointment.updated`
- `appointment.cancelled`
- `appointment.rescheduled`
- `call.created`
- `call.updated`
- `call.completed`
- `call.failed`
- `customer.created`
- `customer.merged`
- `metrics.updated`
- `mcp.alert`

#### Custom Events
- Companies can define custom events with JSON schemas
- Events are validated against schemas
- Custom events trigger webhooks like standard events

### Webhook Features

1. **Subscription Management**
   - Subscribe to specific events or all events (*)
   - Filter events by criteria (branch, duration, etc.)
   - Active/inactive status management
   - Retry count tracking

2. **Webhook Delivery**
   - Asynchronous processing via queues
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff (1min, 5min, 15min)
   - Automatic disabling after 10 failures
   - Request/response logging

3. **Security**
   - Webhook signatures in headers
   - Timestamp validation
   - SSL/TLS required for production

4. **Testing**
   - Built-in webhook testing interface
   - Test payload generation
   - Response preview

### Event Flow

1. **Event Occurs**: Business action triggers Laravel event
2. **Event Logger**: Captures and logs event to database
3. **Webhook Trigger**: Checks subscriptions and queues webhooks
4. **Webhook Delivery**: Sends HTTP POST to subscriber endpoints
5. **Response Handling**: Logs success/failure, implements retry

### Usage Examples

#### Subscribe to Events
```javascript
// Subscribe to appointment events
await axiosInstance.post('/events/subscriptions', {
    webhook_url: 'https://example.com/webhook',
    event_names: ['appointment.created', 'appointment.cancelled'],
    active: true
});
```

#### Query Event History
```javascript
// Get events for specific entity
const response = await axiosInstance.get('/events/timeline', {
    params: {
        entity_type: 'appointment',
        entity_id: 123,
        include_related: true
    }
});
```

#### Test Webhook
```javascript
// Test webhook endpoint
await axiosInstance.post('/events/test-webhook', {
    webhook_url: 'https://example.com/webhook',
    event_name: 'test.webhook',
    payload: { test: true }
});
```

### Benefits

1. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all business events
2. **Integration**: Easy third-party integrations via webhooks
3. **Debugging**: Event replay for troubleshooting
4. **Analytics**: Built-in event statistics
5. **Compliance**: Audit trail for regulatory requirements
6. **Flexibility**: Custom events for specific business needs

### Next Steps

1. **Add more event types** as business logic expands
2. **Implement event sourcing** for specific aggregates
3. **Add webhook authentication** options (OAuth, API keys)
4. **Create event documentation** generator
5. **Build event visualization** timeline UI
