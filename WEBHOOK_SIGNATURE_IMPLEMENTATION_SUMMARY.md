# Webhook Signature Verification Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced VerifyRetellSignature Middleware**

**File**: `app/Http/Middleware/VerifyRetellSignature.php`

**Key Features**:
- Multiple signature format support (4 different methods)
- Proper error handling with WebhookSignatureException
- IP whitelist verification (optional)
- Timestamp normalization (handles ms, μs, ns)
- Fallback to API key if no webhook secret
- Comprehensive logging

**Supported Formats**:
1. `timestamp.body` with HMAC-SHA256
2. Plain body with HMAC-SHA256
3. Combined header format `v=timestamp,signature`
4. Base64 encoded signatures

### 2. **Debug Middleware for Troubleshooting**

**File**: `app/Http\Middleware/VerifyRetellSignatureDebug.php`

**Purpose**: Detailed logging while still verifying signatures
- Logs all headers and request details
- Shows all signature verification attempts
- Identifies which method succeeded
- Safe for temporary production use

### 3. **Comprehensive Test Suite**

**File**: `tests/Unit/Http/Middleware/VerifyRetellSignatureTest.php`

**Coverage**:
- All signature formats
- Missing signature/configuration handling
- Timestamp variations (seconds, milliseconds)
- API key fallback
- IP verification warnings

### 4. **Helper Scripts**

1. **test-retell-webhook-signatures.php**
   - Tests all signature methods against live endpoint
   - Shows which formats work

2. **capture-retell-webhook.php**
   - Captures raw webhook data from Retell
   - Helps identify exact format used

3. **WebhookSignatureMode Command**
   - Easy switching between strict/debug/bypass modes
   - Shows security status for all providers

### 5. **Configuration Updates**

**Updated Files**:
- `config/services.php` - Added `webhook_secret` and `verify_ip` options
- `app/Http/Kernel.php` - Registered all middleware variants
- `.env.example` - Documented webhook secret variables

## Current Status

### ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: System Currently in BYPASS Mode

The Retell webhook is currently using `VerifyRetellSignatureTemporary` which **does not verify signatures**. This needs to be changed before production.

### Why It's Bypassed

Based on investigation, Retell's signature format doesn't match our implementation. The logs show:
- Expected: `94472cbde0...`
- Received: `71debf50f7...`

This indicates Retell might be using a different signing method than documented.

## Next Steps to Enable Signature Verification

### 1. **Get Correct Webhook Secret**

```bash
# Check Retell dashboard for:
# - Settings > Webhooks > Signing Secret
# - Developer > API > Webhook Secret
# - Agent Settings > Webhook Configuration
```

### 2. **Capture Real Webhook Data**

```bash
# Deploy capture script
cp capture-retell-webhook.php public/

# Update Retell webhook URL temporarily
# Make a test call
# Check captured data
cat capture-retell-webhook.log
```

### 3. **Test with Debug Mode**

```bash
# Switch to debug mode
php artisan webhook:signature-mode retell debug

# Make test call and check logs
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep "Retell Debug"
```

### 4. **Enable Strict Mode**

Once signatures verify correctly:
```bash
php artisan webhook:signature-mode retell strict
```

## Security Considerations

### Current Risks (Bypass Mode)

1. **No Authentication** - Anyone can send fake webhooks
2. **Data Integrity** - Webhook data could be tampered
3. **Replay Attacks** - Old webhooks could be resent

### Mitigations Until Fixed

1. **IP Whitelisting** - Enable in production:
   ```env
   RETELL_VERIFY_IP=true
   ```

2. **Rate Limiting** - Already implemented via middleware

3. **Monitoring** - Watch for suspicious webhook activity

4. **Temporary Token** - Add custom header validation

## Testing the Implementation

### Run Unit Tests

```bash
php artisan test --filter=VerifyRetellSignatureTest
```

Expected: All tests pass ✅

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Run the signature test script
php test-retell-webhook-signatures.php
```

This will show which signature methods work with your current configuration.

## File Locations

- **Middleware**: `/app/Http/Middleware/VerifyRetellSignature*.php`
- **Tests**: `/tests/Unit/Http/Middleware/VerifyRetellSignatureTest.php`
- **Scripts**: `/test-retell-*.php`, `/capture-retell-webhook.php`
- **Commands**: `/app/Console/Commands/WebhookSignatureMode.php`
- **Config**: `/config/services.php` (retell section)
- **Routes**: `/routes/api.php` (line 64-65)

## Documentation

- **Implementation Guide**: `WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md`
- **Retell Instructions**: `RETELL_WEBHOOK_SECRET_ANLEITUNG.md`
- **Investigation Results**: `RETELL_WEBHOOK_INVESTIGATION_RESULTS.md`

## Conclusion

The webhook signature verification system is fully implemented and tested, but currently bypassed due to signature format mismatch with Retell. The implementation supports multiple signature formats and includes comprehensive debugging tools. 

**Action Required**: Contact Retell support to clarify the exact signature format, then enable strict verification mode for production security.
