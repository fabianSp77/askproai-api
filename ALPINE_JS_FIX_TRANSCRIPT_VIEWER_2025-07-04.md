# Alpine.js Display Issues Fix - Transcript Viewer & System-Wide

## Problem Summary
The user reported that elements with data are not displaying properly throughout the application, with specific issues in the transcript viewer. This is a common Alpine.js initialization timing issue.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Component Definition Timing**: The `transcriptViewerEnterprise` function is defined inside a `@push('scripts')` block, which loads after Alpine tries to initialize the component.

2. **Alpine Initialization Order**: Components defined in Blade files may not be available when Alpine.js starts.

3. **Livewire/Alpine Conflicts**: When Livewire updates the DOM, Alpine components may not reinitialize properly.

## Immediate Fixes Applied

### 1. Alpine Diagnostic Script
Created `/resources/js/alpine-diagnostic-fix.js` that:
- Detects Alpine loading issues
- Fixes empty or malformed x-data attributes
- Reinitializes missed components
- Sets up mutation observers for dynamic content
- Provides console logging for debugging

### 2. Fixed Transcript Viewer
Created `/resources/views/filament/infolists/transcript-viewer-enterprise-fixed.blade.php` that:
- Defines the Alpine component in `alpine:init` event
- Ensures component is registered before use
- Adds console logging for debugging
- Properly initializes all data properties

## How to Apply the Fixes

### Step 1: Build Assets
```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Test the Fixed Transcript Viewer
Replace the original transcript viewer with the fixed version:
```bash
cp resources/views/filament/infolists/transcript-viewer-enterprise-fixed.blade.php \
   resources/views/filament/infolists/transcript-viewer-enterprise.blade.php
```

### Step 3: Clear Caches
```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan filament:cache-components
```

### Step 4: Browser Debugging
Open browser console and run:
```javascript
// Check Alpine status
Alpine

// Run diagnostics
window.runAlpineDiagnostics()

// Force fix specific component
window.fixAlpineComponent('transcriptViewerEnterprise')

// Check all Alpine components
document.querySelectorAll('[x-data]')
```
