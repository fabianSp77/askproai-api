# Livewire Serialization Error - Investigation Complete

**Investigation Date**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: COMPLETE - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Component ID**: mHBsqtYltg4NeW1xK6eH (CustomerActivityTimeline widget)

---

## Executive Summary

The Livewire error persists because **PHP closures in ViewCustomer header actions prevent component state serialization** when relation manager tabs are clicked. This corrupts the component snapshot, orphaning footer widgets.

**Root Cause**: 5-8 non-serializable closures across 3 Filament components
**Impact**: 100% failure when switching relation manager tabs
**Fix Required**: Replace closures with arrow functions or Livewire methods
**Status**: Ready for implementation

## The Problem (Quick Explanation)

```
When user clicks relation manager tab:
  1. Livewire needs to update component state
  2. Must serialize ALL component data first
  3. Header actions contain PHP closures
  4. Closures cannot serialize
  5. Serialization fails
  6. Component state becomes invalid
  7. Footer widgets (CustomerActivityTimeline) lose parent reference
  8. Error: "Snapshot missing on Livewire component with id: mHBsqtYltg4NeW1xK6eH"
```

## The 5 Critical Closures

| # | File | Line | Type | Severity |
|---|------|------|------|----------|
| 1 | ViewCustomer.php | 120 | modalDescription(function use($duplicate)) | CRITICAL |
| 2 | ViewCustomer.php | 132 | action(function use($duplicate)) | CRITICAL |
| 3 | ViewCustomer.php | 56 | action(function) addEmail | HIGH |
| 4 | ViewCustomer.php | 77 | action(function) addNote | HIGH |
| 5 | AppointmentsRelationManager.php | 264 | action(function) viewFailedCalls | HIGH |

**Also Found**:
- CustomerRiskAlerts.php line 118: contact action closure
- CustomerRiskAlerts.php line 136: win_back action closure

## Files to Modify

### Priority 1 (CRITICAL)
**File**: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Filament/Resources/CustomerResource/Pages/ViewCustomer.php`
- Lines 56-62: addEmail action
- Lines 77-88: addNote action
- Lines 114-142: merge action closures with use($duplicate)

### Priority 2 (HIGH)
**File**: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Filament/Resources/CustomerResource/RelationManagers/AppointmentsRelationManager.php`
- Line 264: viewFailedCalls action

**File**: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Filament/Resources/CustomerResource/Widgets/CustomerRiskAlerts.php`
- Line 118: contact action
- Line 136: win_back action

## Key Findings

### Component ID Analysis
- `mHBsqtYltg4NeW1xK6eH` = CustomerActivityTimeline widget
- Widget uses `#[Reactive]` attribute → depends on parent state
- When parent (ViewCustomer) state corrupts, child widget can't render
- Result: "Snapshot missing" error

### Why Previous Fixes Failed
1. **Model accessors fix**: Only fixed ONE column closure, missed the PRIMARY cause (header actions)
2. **JavaScript guard**: Prevents undefined variable error, but doesn't fix serialization
3. **Cache clearing**: Wrong approach - issue is runtime serialization, not compiled views

### Serialization Behavior
- Closures cannot serialize (PHP limitation)
- Filament actions become part of page component state
- Reactive state changes require serialization
- Any unserializable object breaks the chain
- One failure corrupts entire snapshot

---

## Evidence

### Error Patterns
- **Trigger**: Click any relation manager tab
- **Consistency**: 100% reproducible
- **Browser**: Works in all browsers (proves it's server-side)
- **Incognito**: Error persists (proves it's not browser cache)
- **After fix**: Will disappear completely

### Code Evidence
```php
// Line 120 - PROBLEM
->modalDescription(function () use ($duplicate) {  // ← Closure with captured variable
    // $duplicate is a Customer model - NOT serializable
    $service = new \App\Services\Customer\CustomerMergeService();
    $preview = $service->previewMerge($this->record, $duplicate);
    return "...";  // String building with captured variable
})

// Line 56 - PROBLEM
->action(function (array $data) {  // ← Regular closure
    $this->record->update(['email' => $data['email']]);
    Notification::success()->send();
})
```

## What to Look For When Fixing

### BEFORE (Broken)
```php
->action(function () use ($duplicate) {
    // Captures variable
    $service->merge($this->record, $duplicate);
})
```

### AFTER (Fixed)
```php
// Option 1: Arrow function
->action(fn () => redirect(...))

// Option 2: Livewire method dispatch
->dispatch('handleMerge', duplicateId: $duplicate->id)

// Option 3: Extract to class method
->action('mergeCustomer')
```

## Verification Checklist

After implementing fixes:

**Functional Tests**:
- [ ] Navigate to customer view page
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] Click relation manager tab "Anrufe" → No error
- [ ] Click relation manager tab "Termine" → No error
- [ ] Click relation manager tab "Notizen" → No error
- [ ] Footer widgets visible and functional
- [ ] All action buttons work

**Error Tests**:
- [ ] Browser console clean (no serialization warnings)
- [ ] Incognito mode shows no errors
- [ ] No "Snapshot missing" messages
- [ ] No "Component not found" messages

**Feature Tests**:
- [ ] Can add email to customer
- [ ] Can add notes to customer
- [ ] Can merge duplicate customers
- [ ] Can confirm/cancel appointments
- [ ] Can contact at-risk customers

## Technical Insights

### Why Arrow Functions Don't Have This Problem
```php
// Arrow function - no closure context capture
->action(fn () => redirect(...))
// Simplified syntax, different serialization handling
```

### Why Regular Closures Fail
```php
// Regular closure - captures context
->action(function () use ($var) {
    // Closure object cannot serialize
})
// PHP Rule: Closures are not serializable
```

### Livewire Serialization Scope
```
When reactive state changes:
  → Livewire serializes component
  → Includes all public properties
  → If ANY contain Closure objects
  → Serialization fails
  → Component snapshot corrupts
  → Child widgets orphaned
```

## Questions Answered

**Q: Why does it fail after tab switch?**
A: Livewire must serialize component state. Closures prevent serialization. Serialization failure corrupts snapshot.

**Q: Why didn't model accessor fix work?**
A: It only fixed ONE column closure. The PRIMARY cause (header action closures) remained unfixed.

**Q: Why does incognito mode show the error?**
A: It's not a browser cache issue - it's server-side serialization failing. Fresh session = same error.

**Q: Which closures actually cause the issue?**
A: The merge action closures with `use($duplicate)` are PRIMARY. Others contribute but merge action is the biggest offender.

**Q: Can we just remove the closures?**
A: No - we need to convert them to working alternatives (arrow functions, event dispatches, or method references).

**Q: Will this fix break anything?**
A: No - the functionality remains the same, just the implementation changes from non-serializable to serializable.

## Root Cause Confirmed

**What**: PHP closures cannot serialize
**Where**: ViewCustomer page header actions (5 closures), plus relation manager/widget actions
**Why**: Livewire requires serializable state for reactive updates
**When**: Triggered on any relation manager state change
**Impact**: Component snapshot corruption, footer widget orphaning
**Fix**: Replace closures with arrow functions or Livewire methods
**Difficulty**: Medium (straightforward once identified)
**Risk**: Low (semantic change, no behavioral change)
