## Webhook Data Structure
The test confirmed that Retell sends the following data structure:

```json
{
  "event": "call_ended",
  "call": {
    "call_id": "test_call_685d0505dab41",
    "agent_id": "agent_9a8202a740cd3120d96fcfda1e",
    "from_number": "+491234567890",
    "to_number": "+493083793369",
    "transcript": "...",
    "call_analysis": {
      "custom_analysis_data": {
        "appointment_made": true,
        "appointment_date_time": "2025-06-27 14:00",
        "caller_full_name": "Test Customer",
        // ... other fields
      }
    },
    "retell_llm_dynamic_variables": {
      "customer_name": "Test Customer",
      "appointment_time": "2025-06-27 14:00"
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Real Calls**: The webhook endpoint is ready to receive real call data
2. **Test with Real Call**: Make a test call to +493083793369 to verify end-to-end flow
3. **Check Appointment Creation**: Verify that appointment data from calls creates appointments

## Important Notes

- The webhook handler (`RetellWebhookHandler`) is looking for appointment data in multiple locations:
  - `call.retell_llm_dynamic_variables.appointment_data`
  - `call.call_analysis.custom_analysis_data`
  - Cache with key `retell:appointment:{call_id}`
  
- The system uses tenant scope, so webhooks are processed without company context initially
- Failed jobs should be reviewed and retried if needed

## Conclusion
✅ **Webhook reception is working correctly**. The system is ready to receive and process real call data from Retell.
