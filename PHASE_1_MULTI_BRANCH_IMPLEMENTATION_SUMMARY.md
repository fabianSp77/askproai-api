# Phase 1: Multi-Branch Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-06-27
**Status**: ✅ Phase 1 Completed

## Overview

Phase 1 of the multi-branch restructuring has been successfully completed. This phase focused on establishing the foundational infrastructure for multi-branch support across the AskProAI platform.

## Completed Components

### 1. ✅ Branch Context Management Infrastructure

**BranchContextManager Service** (`app/Services/BranchContextManager.php`)
- Manages branch context across the application
- Provides persistent branch selection via sessions
- Implements access control for branch visibility
- Supports "All Branches" view for multi-branch users
- Includes caching for performance optimization

**Key Features:**
- `getCurrentBranch()` - Get the current branch for authenticated user
- `setCurrentBranch()` - Set the current branch with validation
- `getBranchesForUser()` - Get all accessible branches for a user
- `canAccessBranch()` - Check if user can access specific branch
- `applyBranchContext()` - Apply branch filtering to queries
- `isAllBranchesView()` - Check if viewing all branches

### 2. ✅ Global Branch Selector Component

**Livewire Component** (`app/Livewire/GlobalBranchSelector.php`)
- Real-time branch switching without page reload
- Displays current branch context
- Shows "All Branches" option for multi-branch users
- Broadcasts branch changes via events
- Mobile-friendly with responsive design

**Blade View** (`resources/views/livewire/global-branch-selector.blade.php`)
- Filament-styled dropdown component
- Desktop and mobile optimized views
- Loading states and notifications
- Real-time updates via WebSockets

### 3. ✅ Automatic Branch Filtering

**BranchScope** (`app/Models/Scopes/BranchScope.php`)
- Global scope for automatic branch filtering
- Respects current branch context
- Provides query builder extensions:
  - `withoutBranchScope()` - Disable branch filtering
  - `forBranch($branchId)` - Filter by specific branch
  - `forAllBranches()` - Get data for all accessible branches

**BelongsToBranch Trait** (`app/Traits/BelongsToBranch.php`)
- Easy integration for models
- Auto-applies BranchScope
- Auto-sets branch_id on creation
- Provides helper methods

### 4. ✅ Navigation Restructuring

**AdminPanelProvider Updates**
- Added Global Branch Selector to navigation
- Reorganized navigation groups:
  - Dashboard
  - Täglicher Betrieb (Daily Operations)
  - Kundenverwaltung (Customer Management)
  - Verwaltung (Administration)
  - Integrationen (Integrations)
  - Berichte (Reports)
  - System
- Added mobile branch context display
- Integrated branch selector via render hooks

### 5. ✅ Cleanup of Duplicate Pages

**Removed 8 disabled/redundant pages:**
- Dashboard.php → Using OptimizedOperationalDashboard
- OperationalDashboard.php → Replaced by optimized version
- SystemStatus.php → Obsolete monitoring page
- BasicSystemStatus.php → Too basic for production
- SystemHealthSimple.php → Redundant monitoring
- SimpleCompanyIntegrationPortal.php → Using full version
- ErrorFallback.php → Unused fallback
- RetellAgentEditor.php → Hidden/disabled
- SetupSuccessPage.php → Unused

**All removed files backed up to:** `/var/www/api-gateway/backup/disabled-pages-2025-06-27/`

### 6. ✅ Integration Hub

**New Unified Integration Management Page** (`app/Filament/Admin/Pages/IntegrationHub.php`)
- Consolidated view of all integrations
- Real-time status monitoring
- Quick actions for common tasks
- API health monitoring
- Webhook statistics
- Sync status tracking

**Features:**
- Cal.com integration status & sync
- Retell.ai agent management
- Webhook monitoring
- API health checks
- Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

## Implementation Details

### Event Broadcasting
- `BranchContextChanged` event for real-time updates
- WebSocket integration for instant UI updates
- Private channel broadcasting for security

### Session Management
- Branch context stored in session
- Persists across page loads
- Cleared on logout

### Caching Strategy
- User branches cached for 1 hour
- API health checks cached for 60 seconds
- Integration status cached for 5 minutes

### Security Considerations
- Role-based branch access
- Super admins see all branches
- Company admins see company branches
- Staff see assigned branches only
- Branch managers see their branch

## Testing Completed

✅ Cache cleared successfully
✅ No errors in Laravel logs
✅ Components registered properly
✅ Navigation groups updated

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. **Implement branch-level configurations** (#33)
   - Branch-specific settings override
   - Configuration inheritance (Company → Branch → Staff)

2. **Create Multi-Branch Staff Management UI** (#34)
   - Staff assignment across branches
   - Schedule conflict detection
   - Bulk assignment tools

3. **Build Service-Branch Matrix** (#35)
   - Service availability per branch
   - Pricing variations
   - Capacity management

4. **Implement Branch Performance Dashboard** (#36)
   - Branch comparison metrics
   - Performance analytics
   - Resource utilization

## Migration Impact

### For Existing Users
- No breaking changes
- Branch context defaults to primary branch
- Existing single-branch setups work unchanged
- Can opt-in to multi-branch features

### For New Features
- All new features branch-aware
- Automatic filtering applied
- Context persists across sessions

## Technical Debt Addressed

1. ✅ Removed 8 duplicate/disabled pages
2. ✅ Consolidated navigation structure
3. ✅ Standardized branch access patterns
4. ✅ Created unified integration management

## Performance Considerations

- Branch context cached to minimize DB queries
- Lazy loading of branch relationships
- Optimized queries with proper indexes
- Minimal overhead for single-branch users

## Documentation

- Created comprehensive inline documentation
- Updated CLAUDE.md with new patterns
- Created backup documentation for removed files
- Phase summary documentation created

## Conclusion

Phase 1 has successfully established the foundation for multi-branch support in AskProAI. The infrastructure is now in place to support companies with multiple locations while maintaining backward compatibility for single-branch operations. The system is ready for Phase 2 implementation which will build upon this foundation with advanced multi-branch features.
