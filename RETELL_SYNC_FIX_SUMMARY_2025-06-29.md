# Retell Agent Synchronization Fix Summary
Date: 2025-06-29

## Problem Reported
- Agent data not matching what's shown in Retell.ai
- Agents not properly connected to companies and branches
- Phone numbers not assigned to branches for call routing

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Data Structure Mismatch**: Code was transforming flat API responses into nested structures
2. **Missing Relationships**: Agent-phone-branch relationships weren't established
3. **Version Fields Not Populated**: Version information wasn't being saved to database
4. **Model Configuration**: Version fields weren't in the fillable array

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Data Storage (RetellAgent Model)
- Modified `syncFromRetell` method to store raw API data without transformation
- Ensures data matches exactly what's in Retell.ai

### 2. Updated MCP Server
- Modified `RetellMCPServer::syncAgentDetails` to store raw data
- Removed `transformAgentConfiguration` calls

### 3. Created Proper Sync Script
- `force-retell-sync-v2.php` properly links agents with phone numbers
- Establishes agent→phone→branch→company relationships
- Stores version information directly from API

### 4. Fixed UI Loading
- Updated `loadAgents` method in RetellUltimateControlCenter
- Includes relationship data (phone, branch) in agent display
- Uses database version fields instead of parsing from names

### 5. Model Configuration
- Added `version`, `version_title`, `is_published` to fillable array
- Ensures version fields can be properly saved

## Current State
- ✅ 11 agents synced with flat structure (matching Retell API)
- ✅ Version information properly displayed
- ✅ 1 agent (Fabian Spitzer) linked to phone/branch
- ⚠️ 10 agents need phone numbers assigned

## Next Steps
1. Assign phone numbers to remaining agents through UI
2. Ensure each phone number is linked to appropriate branch
3. Test call routing with properly linked agents

## Key Files Modified
- `/app/Models/RetellAgent.php` - Added fillable fields, fixed sync method
- `/app/Services/MCP/RetellMCPServer.php` - Store raw data
- `/app/Filament/Admin/Pages/RetellUltimateControlCenter.php` - Fixed loading
- `/force-retell-sync-v2.php` - Proper sync with relationships

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Check agent data structure
php check-retell-ui-data.php

# Verify relationships
php verify-retell-relationships.php

# Re-sync all agents
php force-retell-sync-v2.php
```
