# Security Backup - 2025-06-27

This directory contains critical security-enhanced files created during the security hardening sprint on June 27, 2025.

## Files Included

### 1. Encrypted Models
- **Tenant_ENCRYPTED.php** - Automatic API key encryption for tenants
- **RetellConfiguration_ENCRYPTED.php** - Encrypted Retell API credentials
- **CustomerAuth_ENCRYPTED.php** - Encrypted customer authentication tokens

### 2. Multi-Tenancy Security
- **BelongsToCompany_SECURE.php** - Secure trait preventing cross-tenant access
- **CompanyScope_SECURE.php** - Global scope with security hardening
- **WebhookCompanyResolver_SECURE.php** - Secure webhook company resolution

## Key Security Features

### Encryption
- Uses Laravel's Crypt facade (AES-256-CBC)
- Automatic encryption/decryption on model events
- Backward compatible with existing data

### Multi-Tenancy
- Removed dangerous header/session fallbacks
- Enforces authenticated user context only
- Returns empty result sets when no company context
- Comprehensive security logging

### Webhook Security
- No fallback to random companies
- Multiple resolution strategies with validation
- Critical failure notifications

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Backup existing files** before replacing
2. **Test in staging** environment first
3. **Run migrations** to ensure encrypted columns exist
4. **Monitor logs** for any security warnings
5. **Verify** webhook processing still works

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Restore original files from backup
2. Clear application cache: `php artisan optimize:clear`
3. Restart queue workers: `php artisan horizon:terminate`
4. Monitor error logs

## Security Notes

- These files fix critical vulnerabilities
- Do NOT modify without security review
- Keep backups of both versions
- Test thoroughly before production deployment
