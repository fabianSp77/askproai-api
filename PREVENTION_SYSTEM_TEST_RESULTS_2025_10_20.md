## 🎯 Next Real-World Test

### When Next Appointment Is Booked

**What Will Happen**:

1. **User calls** Retell agent
2. **Agent books** appointment via Cal.com
3. **AppointmentCreationService** creates appointment
4. **🛡️ PostBookingValidation** runs automatically:
   - Check: Appointment exists in DB?
   - Check: Linked to correct call?
   - Check: Cal.com booking ID matches?
   - Check: Timestamps recent (<5 min)?
   - Check: Call flags consistent?
5. **If all pass**: ✅ Booking confirmed
6. **If any fail**:
   - 🔄 Automatic rollback of call flags
   - 📝 Log to data_consistency_alerts
   - 📧 Alert admin
   - 📋 Add to manual review queue

**Monitor Live**:
```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -i "post-booking\|validation"
```

---

## 📋 Monitoring Commands

### Check System Health
```bash
# 1. Check alerts
mysql -u root askproai_db -e "
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_alerts, alert_type, severity
FROM data_consistency_alerts
GROUP BY alert_type, severity
ORDER BY severity DESC, total_alerts DESC;"

# 2. Check circuit breaker state
mysql -u root askproai_db -e "
SELECT
    service_key,
    current_state,
    failure_count,
    last_failure_at
FROM circuit_breaker_states
ORDER BY last_failure_at DESC;"

# 3. Check manual review queue
mysql -u root askproai_db -e "
SELECT COUNT(*) as pending
FROM manual_review_queue
WHERE status = 'pending';"

# 4. Live monitoring
tail -f storage/logs/data-consistency.log
```
