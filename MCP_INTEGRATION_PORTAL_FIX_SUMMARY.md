# MCP Integration Portal Fix Summary

## Problems Fixed
1. ArgumentCountError when trying to instantiate WebhookMCPServer without its required dependencies
2. Missing `phoneNumbers` relationship on Branch model
3. Incorrect field reference `is_active` instead of `active` for branches
4. Typed property must not be accessed before initialization error in Livewire component

## Error Details

### Error 1: ArgumentCountError
```
ArgumentCountError: Too few arguments to function App\Services\MCP\WebhookMCPServer::__construct(), 
0 passed in /var/www/api-gateway/app/Filament/Admin/Pages/CompanyIntegrationPortal.php on line 61 
and exactly 4 expected
```

### Error 2: RelationNotFoundException
```
Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\RelationNotFoundException
Call to undefined relationship [phoneNumbers] on model [App\Models\Branch].
```

### Error 3: Uninitialized Property Error
```
Error
Typed property App\Filament\Admin\Pages\CompanyIntegrationPortal::$webhookService 
must not be accessed before initialization
```

## Root Cause
The WebhookMCPServer constructor requires 4 dependencies:
- CalcomMCPServer
- RetellMCPServer
- DatabaseMCPServer
- QueueMCPServer

The code was trying to instantiate it with `new WebhookMCPServer()` instead of using Laravel's dependency injection.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated CompanyIntegrationPortal.php
Changed the service initialization from manual instantiation to using Laravel's service container:

```php
// Before (incorrect)
protected function initializeServices(): void
{
    $this->calcomService = new CalcomMCPServer();
    $this->retellService = new RetellMCPServer();
    $this->knowledgeService = new KnowledgeMCPServer();
    $this->stripeService = new StripeMCPServer();
    $this->webhookService = new WebhookMCPServer(); // Error here!
}

// After (correct)
protected function initializeServices(): void
{
    // Use Laravel's service container to properly inject dependencies
    $this->calcomService = app(CalcomMCPServer::class);
    $this->retellService = app(RetellMCPServer::class);
    $this->knowledgeService = app(KnowledgeMCPServer::class);
    $this->stripeService = app(StripeMCPServer::class);
    $this->webhookService = app(WebhookMCPServer::class);
}
```

### 2. Added Missing phoneNumbers Relationship
Added the missing relationship to the Branch model:

```php
/**
 * Get the phone numbers for the branch.
 *
 * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasMany
 */
public function phoneNumbers()
{
    return $this->hasMany(PhoneNumber::class);
}
```

### 3. Fixed Field Name Mismatch
Changed `is_active` to `active` in CompanyIntegrationPortal since Branch model uses `active` field:

```php
// Before
'is_active' => $branch->is_active,

// After
'is_active' => $branch->active,
```

### 4. Added KnowledgeMCPServer to MCPServiceProvider
The KnowledgeMCPServer was not registered in the service provider:

```php
// Added to imports
use App\Services\MCP\KnowledgeMCPServer;

// Added to register() method
$this->app->singleton(KnowledgeMCPServer::class);
```

### 5. Fixed Livewire Service Initialization
Livewire components don't maintain service instances between requests. Changed to:
- Made service properties nullable
- Created getter methods that lazily initialize services
- Updated all service calls to use getters

```php
// Service properties now nullable
protected ?WebhookMCPServer $webhookService = null;

// Getter method with lazy initialization
protected function getWebhookService(): WebhookMCPServer
{
    if (!$this->webhookService) {
        $this->webhookService = app(WebhookMCPServer::class);
    }
    return $this->webhookService;
}

// Usage
$stats = $this->getWebhookService()->getWebhookStats([...]);
```

## Benefits
1. **Proper Dependency Injection**: All dependencies are automatically resolved by Laravel
2. **Singleton Pattern**: Services are instantiated once and reused
3. **Maintainability**: If constructor signatures change, the container handles it
4. **Testing**: Easier to mock services in tests

## Verification
All MCP services now load successfully:
- CalcomMCPServer ✅
- RetellMCPServer ✅
- KnowledgeMCPServer ✅
- StripeMCPServer ✅
- WebhookMCPServer ✅

## Best Practice
Always use Laravel's service container (`app()` helper or constructor injection) when instantiating classes with dependencies. This ensures:
- Dependencies are properly resolved
- Singletons are respected
- Configuration is centralized
- Testing is easier
