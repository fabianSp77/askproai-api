# Filament Admin Pages Cleanup - 2025-06-27

## Summary

Successfully removed 8 disabled/redundant Filament Admin pages from the codebase to reduce clutter and improve maintainability.

## Pages Removed

1. **OperationalDashboard.php** - Replaced by OptimizedOperationalDashboard
2. **SystemStatus.php** - Obsolete monitoring page
3. **BasicSystemStatus.php** - Too basic for production use
4. **SystemHealthSimple.php** - Redundant monitoring page
5. **SimpleCompanyIntegrationPortal.php** - Replaced by CompanyIntegrationPortal
6. **ErrorFallback.php** - Unused fallback error page
7. **RetellAgentEditor.php** - Hidden agent editor (disabled)
8. **SetupSuccessPage.php** - Setup completion page (not in navigation)

## Actions Taken

1. Created backup directory: `/var/www/api-gateway/backup/disabled-pages-2025-06-27/`
2. Moved all disabled pages to backup directory
3. Moved all associated blade view files to `backup/disabled-pages-2025-06-27/views/`
4. Updated `DashboardRouteResolver.php` to reference OptimizedOperationalDashboard instead of OperationalDashboard
5. Updated `AdminPanelProvider.php` to remove explicit registration of Dashboard and OperationalDashboard
6. Created documentation file in backup directory listing all removed pages

## Files Modified

- `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Services/DashboardRouteResolver.php` - Updated mapping for operational-dashboard
- `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php` - Removed explicit page registrations

## Verification

- All 8 files successfully moved to backup directory
- No build errors expected as these pages were already disabled
- Pages can be restored if needed from backup directory

## Next Steps

1. Clear Laravel caches: `php artisan optimize:clear`
2. Test admin panel to ensure no broken links
3. Monitor logs for any unexpected errors
4. Consider removing additional disabled pages found in the directory

## Additional Disabled Pages Found

During the cleanup, other disabled pages were noticed that could be removed in a future cleanup:
- Pages with `.disabled` extension in the directory
- Backup files with `.backup` extension
- Debug pages ending with `Debug.php`

## Restoration Instructions

If any page needs to be restored:
```bash
# Copy from backup
cp /var/www/api-gateway/backup/disabled-pages-2025-06-27/PageName.php /var/www/api-gateway/app/Filament/Admin/Pages/

# Edit the file to enable navigation
# Change shouldRegisterNavigation() to return true

# Clear caches
php artisan optimize:clear
```
