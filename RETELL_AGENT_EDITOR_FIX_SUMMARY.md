# Retell Agent Editor Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Wrong API Endpoint for Getting Agent Versions**
- **Problem**: The code was using `/agent/{agent_id}` which doesn't exist
- **Fix**: Changed to correct endpoint `/get-agent-versions/{agent_id}`
- **File**: `app/Filament/Admin/Pages/RetellAgentEditor.php` (line 68)

### 2. **Incorrect Response Structure Parsing**
- **Problem**: Code expected `agent_id_versions` key in response, but API returns array directly
- **Fix**: Changed to parse the response as a direct array
- **File**: `app/Filament/Admin/Pages/RetellAgentEditor.php` (line 72)

### 3. **Wrong Timestamp Field Names**
- **Problem**: Code used `created_at` field which doesn't exist
- **Fix**: Changed to use `last_modification_timestamp` (in milliseconds)
- **Files**: 
  - `app/Filament/Admin/Pages/RetellAgentEditor.php` (line 75-80)
  - `resources/views/filament/admin/pages/retell-agent-editor.blade.php` (line 75-76, 150)

### 4. **Missing Full Version Data Loading**
- **Problem**: Version list doesn't include all fields like `response_engine`
- **Fix**: Always fetch full agent data with version parameter when selecting a version
- **File**: `app/Filament/Admin/Pages/RetellAgentEditor.php` (line 111-135)

### 5. **Incorrect Published Version Detection**
- **Problem**: Used version comparison instead of `is_published` field
- **Fix**: 
  - Use `is_published` field from version data
  - Find published version by iterating through versions list
- **Files**:
  - `app/Filament/Admin/Pages/RetellAgentEditor.php` (line 83-89)
  - `resources/views/filament/admin/pages/retell-agent-editor.blade.php` (line 82, 114)

## API Structure Discovered

### Get Agent Versions Response:
```json
[
  {
    "version": 30,
    "agent_name": "Agent Name",
    "is_published": false,
    "last_modification_timestamp": 1719598932000
  },
  // ... more versions
]
```

### Get Agent with Version Response:
```json
{
  "agent_id": "agent_xxx",
  "version": 30,
  "is_published": false,
  "agent_name": "Agent Name",
  "response_engine": {
    "type": "retell-llm",
    "llm_id": "llm_xxx"
  },
  "voice_id": "voice_xxx",
  "webhook_url": "https://...",
  // ... all other agent fields
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. When loading the agent editor:
   - Fetches current agent details
   - Fetches all agent versions from `/get-agent-versions/{agent_id}`
   - Sorts versions by `last_modification_timestamp` (newest first)
   - Finds which version is published using `is_published` field
   - Selects the latest version by default

2. When selecting a version:
   - Fetches full agent data with `?version={version}` parameter
   - Displays all configuration fields
   - Shows "Publish This Version" button only if version is not published

3. Version list shows:
   - Version number
   - Last modification date
   - "Published" badge for the currently published version

## Testing

Verified with test script that:
- API endpoints are working correctly
- All 31 versions are retrieved successfully
- Version-specific data can be fetched
- All required fields are present in responses
