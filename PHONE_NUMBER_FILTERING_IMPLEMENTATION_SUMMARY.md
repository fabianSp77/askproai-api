# Phone Number Filtering Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of phone number filtering across the portal to ensure companies only see calls to their own phone numbers, preventing cross-company data exposure.

## Implementation Date
2025-07-03

## Problem Statement
Companies were able to see calls to phone numbers that didn't belong to them when "All Numbers" was selected in filters, creating a security/privacy issue in the multi-tenant system.

## Solution
Added comprehensive phone number filtering across all controllers, services, and widgets that display or process call data.

## Updated Components

### ✅ Portal Controllers

1. **CallController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Portal/CallController.php`)
   - `index()` - Filters calls by company phone numbers
   - `show()` - Filters customer call history
   - `exportCsv()` - Filters export data
   - `getCallStatistics()` - Filters statistics

2. **AnalyticsController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Portal/AnalyticsController.php`)
   - `getCallStatistics()` - Added phone number filter dropdown
   - `getHourlyDistribution()` - Filters hourly data
   - `getTopCustomers()` - Filters top customers

3. **DashboardController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Portal/DashboardController.php`)
   - `getStatistics()` - Filters call counts
   - `getRecentCalls()` - Filters recent calls display
   - `getUpcomingTasks()` - Filters tasks based on calls
   - `getTeamPerformance()` - Filters team statistics

4. **TeamController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Portal/TeamController.php`)
   - `index()` - Team member call statistics now filtered

### ✅ Services

1. **DashboardMetricsService** (`app/Services/Dashboard/DashboardMetricsService.php`)
   - Added `getCompanyPhoneNumbers()` helper method
   - Updated all call-related KPI calculations:
     - `calculateTotalCalls()`
     - `calculateCallAvgDuration()`
     - `calculateCallSuccessRate()`
     - `calculatePositiveSentiment()`
     - `calculateAvgCallCost()`
     - `calculateCallROI()`
     - `calculateConversionRate()`
   - Updated `getOperationalMetrics()` for executive dashboard

### ✅ Filament Admin Widgets

1. **InsightsActionsWidget** (`app/Filament/Admin/Widgets/InsightsActionsWidget.php`)
   - Added phone number filtering to all call queries
   - Filters high duration branches
   - Filters low conversion branches
   - Filters no recent calls check

## Implementation Pattern

### Standard Filter Pattern
```php
// Get company phone numbers
$companyPhoneNumbers = PhoneNumber::where('company_id', $companyId)
    ->where('is_active', true)
    ->pluck('number')
    ->toArray();

// Apply filter to query
$query->whereIn('to_number', $companyPhoneNumbers);
```

### Service Pattern with Caching
```php
private function getCompanyPhoneNumbers(?int $companyId): array
{
    if (!$companyId) {
        return [];
    }
    
    return PhoneNumber::where('company_id', $companyId)
        ->where('is_active', true)
        ->pluck('number')
        ->toArray();
}
```

## Security Benefits
1. **Data Isolation**: Companies can only see calls to their own phone numbers
2. **Multi-tenant Security**: Prevents cross-company data exposure
3. **Consistent Filtering**: Applied uniformly across all access points

## Performance Considerations
1. **Indexed Column**: The `to_number` column should be indexed for performance
2. **whereIn Clause**: Efficient for reasonable numbers of phone numbers per company
3. **Caching**: Consider caching phone numbers list for frequently accessed endpoints

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with companies having multiple phone numbers
2. Test with companies having no active phone numbers
3. Verify filter dropdown functionality in analytics pages
4. Test export functionality maintains filtering

## Future Enhancements
1. Consider creating a trait `FiltersCallsByCompanyPhoneNumbers` for consistency
2. Add caching for company phone numbers list
3. Add monitoring for performance impact
4. Consider pagination for companies with many phone numbers

## Files Modified
1. `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Http/Controllers/Portal/DashboardController.php`
2. `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Http/Controllers/Portal/TeamController.php`
3. `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Services/Dashboard/DashboardMetricsService.php`
4. `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Filament/Admin/Widgets/InsightsActionsWidget.php`

## Verification Steps
```bash
# Check if filtering is working
1. Login as a company user
2. Navigate to /business/calls
3. Verify only calls to company phone numbers are shown
4. Check analytics page filters
5. Test team statistics
6. Verify dashboard widgets
```

## Notes
- The implementation maintains backward compatibility
- No database schema changes were required
- The filtering is applied at the query level for efficiency
- All existing features continue to work with added security
