# Appointment Availability Issue Analysis

## Problem
Customers calling to book appointments are being told "es konnte kein termin gefunden werden" (no appointment could be found).

## Status: RESOLVED ✅

### ✅ Fixed Issues:
1. **Event Type Configuration** - Event type is now properly assigned to staff
2. **Branch Configuration** - Branch now has correct event type ID
3. **Staff-Event Type Assignment** - Proper relationship established
4. **Working Hours** - Staff now has working hours configured (Mon-Fri 9-5)
5. **Availability Check Implementation** - Now checks real working hours and existing appointments
6. **Date Parsing** - German date parsing (e.g., "morgen") now works correctly
7. **Context Resolution** - Properly resolves branch context for availability checks

### 🎯 Current Implementation:
- **Working Hours Based**: Checks staff working hours from database
- **Conflict Detection**: Checks for existing appointments to avoid double-booking
- **German Language Support**: Handles German date inputs like "heute", "morgen", etc.
- **30-Minute Slots**: Generates 30-minute appointment slots
- **Future Times Only**: For today, only shows slots in the future

### ⚠️ Remaining Improvements (Nice to Have):
1. **Cal.com Integration** - Could sync with Cal.com for real-time availability
2. **Service-Based Duration** - Currently uses fixed 30-minute slots
3. **Buffer Times** - No buffer time between appointments
4. **Multi-Staff Optimization** - Could optimize slot distribution across multiple staff members

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Missing Event Type Assignment
- The branch "Hauptfiliale" has a `calcom_event_type_id` of 2563193
- But this event type ID doesn't exist in the `calcom_event_types` table
- The only event type in the database (ID: 1, "Beratungsgespräch") is not assigned to any staff member (`staff_id` is NULL)
- The event type has `setup_status = 'incomplete'`

### 2. Mock Availability Implementation
The `RetellCustomFunctionMCPServer::getAvailableSlots()` method is returning mock data instead of checking real availability:

```php
protected function getAvailableSlots(string $branchId, string $date, ?string $serviceName): array
{
    // TODO: Implement actual availability check
    // For now, return mock data
    $slots = [];
    $start = Carbon::parse($date)->setTime(9, 0);
    $end = Carbon::parse($date)->setTime(17, 0);
    
    while ($start < $end) {
        $slots[] = $start->format('Y-m-d H:i:s');
        $start->addMinutes(30);
    }
    
    return $slots;
}
```

### 3. No Staff-Event Type Assignments
- Only one staff member exists: "Fabian Spitzer"
- The `staff_event_types` table appears to be empty (no assignments between staff and event types)
- Without these assignments, even if the availability check was implemented, no slots would be available

### 4. Database Schema Transition
The system is transitioning from `staff_service_assignments` to `staff_event_types` table, which may be causing confusion in the data setup.

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. Fix Event Type Configuration
```sql
-- Update the branch to use the existing event type
UPDATE branches 
SET calcom_event_type_id = 1 
WHERE id = '35a66176-5376-11f0-b773-0ad77e7a9793';

-- Assign the event type to the staff member
UPDATE calcom_event_types 
SET staff_id = 'd2c95f4c-5380-11f0-b773-0ad77e7a9793',
    setup_status = 'complete'
WHERE id = 1;

-- Create staff-event type assignment
INSERT INTO staff_event_types (staff_id, event_type_id, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES ('d2c95f4c-5380-11f0-b773-0ad77e7a9793', 1, NOW(), NOW());
```

### 2. Implement Real Availability Check
The `getAvailableSlots` method needs to:
1. Query the Cal.com API for real availability
2. Check staff working hours
3. Consider existing appointments
4. Return actual available time slots

### 3. Add Working Hours
Ensure staff members have working hours configured in the `working_hours` table.

## Verification Steps

1. Check if staff has event types assigned:
```sql
SELECT * FROM staff_event_types WHERE staff_id = 'd2c95f4c-5380-11f0-b773-0ad77e7a9793';
```

2. Check if branch has correct event type:
```sql
SELECT b.*, ce.name as event_type_name 
FROM branches b 
LEFT JOIN calcom_event_types ce ON b.calcom_event_type_id = ce.id
WHERE b.id = '35a66176-5376-11f0-b773-0ad77e7a9793';
```

3. Test the availability check:
```bash
php artisan tinker
$mcp = app(\App\Services\MCP\RetellCustomFunctionMCPServer::class);
$result = $mcp->check_availability([
    'datum' => 'morgen',
    'dienstleistung' => 'Beratung',
    'to_number' => '+491234567890'
]);
print_r($result);
```

## Long-term Recommendations

1. Complete the Cal.com integration for real-time availability
2. Add proper error handling and logging for troubleshooting
3. Create an admin interface for managing staff-event type assignments
4. Add monitoring for appointment booking success rates
5. Implement fallback availability logic when Cal.com is unavailable
