- ✅ Tenant scope enforcement on all models
- ✅ Super admin override capabilities
- ✅ Bulk operation tenant boundary respect

### API Security
- ✅ Authentication requirements on all endpoints
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ SQL injection protection testing
- ✅ XSS prevention verification
- ✅ CSRF protection on state-changing operations
- ✅ Rate limiting on API endpoints

### Session Security
- ✅ Portal-specific session configurations
- ✅ Session isolation between admin and business portals
- ✅ Secure cookie settings (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- ✅ Session timeout and cleanup
- ✅ Concurrent session handling

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Test Architecture
- **Framework**: Laravel's built-in testing framework with PHPUnit
- **Database**: SQLite in-memory for fast, isolated test execution
- **Mocking**: External service mocking via TestsWithMocks trait
- **Data Management**: RefreshDatabase trait for clean test state

### Key Testing Patterns Used
- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear test structure for maintainability
- **Factory Pattern**: Consistent test data generation
- **Guard Testing**: Separate testing for different authentication guards
- **Boundary Testing**: Edge cases and security boundaries
- **Integration Testing**: Complete user workflow validation

### Performance Considerations
- **Fast Execution**: Tests designed to run in under 2 minutes
- **Memory Efficient**: In-memory database prevents disk I/O
- **Parallel Capable**: Tests can be run in parallel for faster CI
- **Isolated**: Each test is completely independent

## 📊 Test Coverage Analysis

## 🚀 Execution Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all portal tests
./run-portal-tests.sh

# Run specific test category
php artisan test tests/Feature/Auth/ --no-coverage

# Run with detailed output
php artisan test tests/Feature/Security/MultiTenantSecurityTest.php -v
```

### Continuous Integration
```bash
# CI-friendly command (stops on first failure)
php artisan test tests/Feature/Auth/ tests/Feature/Security/ tests/Feature/Portal/ --stop-on-failure --no-coverage
```

## 🔍 Quality Assurance
