### 6. Password Reset Flow Tests
**File:** `/var/www/api-gateway/tests/Feature/Auth/PasswordResetFlowTest.php`

**Coverage:**
- Password reset request handling
- Reset token generation and validation
- Reset form functionality
- Token expiration handling
- Password validation during reset
- Rate limiting on reset requests
- Email notification testing
- Session invalidation after reset

**Key Test Cases:**
- ✅ Password reset requests generate tokens
- ✅ Reset emails are sent to valid users
- ✅ Invalid tokens are rejected
- ✅ Password reset works with valid tokens
- ✅ Weak passwords are rejected
- ✅ Tokens expire appropriately
- ✅ Rate limiting prevents abuse
- ✅ Sessions are invalidated after reset

## Existing Authentication Tests Analysis

### Currently Available Tests:
1. **UnifiedAuthTest.php** - Comprehensive login flow testing
2. **BusinessPortalAuthTest.php** - Portal-specific authentication
3. **RateLimitingSecurityTest.php** - Brute force protection
4. **AdminAuthTest.php** - Admin authentication flows
5. **TwoFactorAuthenticationTest.php** - 2FA implementation
6. **SecureAuthenticationServiceTest.php** - Core auth service unit tests

### Test Coverage Gaps Addressed:
1. **Middleware Testing** - Previously missing comprehensive middleware tests
2. **API Authentication** - Limited API v2 authentication coverage
3. **Multi-tenant Isolation** - Insufficient tenant isolation testing
4. **Security Vulnerabilities** - Missing comprehensive security tests
5. **Session Management** - Limited session security testing
6. **Password Reset** - Incomplete password reset flow testing
