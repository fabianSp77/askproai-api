# üõ°Ô∏è Security Fixes Summary - June 26, 2025

## Executive Summary
All critical security vulnerabilities identified in the security audit have been successfully fixed. The system's security score has been maintained at 81.25% with zero critical or high-risk vulnerabilities remaining.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
- **Issue**: Raw SQL queries with user input in DatabaseMCPServer
- **Fix**: Implemented parameterized queries and created SqlProtectionService
- **Files**: `app/Services/MCP/DatabaseMCPServer.php`, `app/Services/Security/SqlProtectionService.php`

### 2. ‚úÖ Multi-Tenancy Bypass
- **Issue**: TenantScope was empty, CompanyScope trusted client headers
- **Fix**: Proper implementation that only trusts authenticated user context
- **Files**: `app/Models/Scopes/CompanyScope.php`, `app/Models/Scopes/TenantScope.php`

### 3. ‚úÖ Authentication Bypass
- **Issue**: Multiple API endpoints without authentication, test endpoints in production
- **Fix**: Added authentication middleware, removed all test/debug endpoints
- **Files**: `routes/api.php`, created `app/Http/Middleware/ValidateCompanyContext.php`

### 4. ‚úÖ Webhook Security
- **Issue**: Some webhooks without signature verification
- **Fix**: All webhooks now require proper signature verification
- **Files**: `routes/api.php`, created `routes/api-secure-webhooks.php`

## Current Security Status
```
Total Checks: 16
Passed: 13
Failed: 3 (all low priority optional enhancements)
Security Score: 81.25%

## Breaking Changes
1. All `/api/mcp/*` endpoints now require authentication
2. Test endpoints removed: `/api/test/webhook`, `/api/calcom/book-test`, etc.
3. Debug webhooks removed: `/api/retell/webhook-debug`, `/api/retell/webhook-nosig`
4. `X-Company-Id` header no longer accepted for tenant context

## Next Steps
1. Deploy immediately to production
2. Update API documentation for authentication requirements
3. Notify clients about breaking changes
4. Monitor logs for any authentication issues post-deployment
