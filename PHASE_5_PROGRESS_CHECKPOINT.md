- Designed 7 domain boundaries
- Created comprehensive refactoring plan

**Files**:
- `claudedocs/07_ARCHITECTURE/PHASE_5_ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING_PLAN_2025-10-18.md`

### 2. Event Infrastructure (100%)

**Created Files**:

1. **`app/Shared/Events/DomainEvent.php`** (127 lines)
   - Abstract base class for all domain events
   - UUID event IDs for deduplication
   - Correlation IDs for tracing
   - Aggregate tracking for event sourcing
   - Serialization/deserialization support
   - ✅ TESTED AND WORKING

2. **`app/Shared/Events/EventListener.php`** (71 lines)
   - Interface for event subscribers
   - Priority-based execution
   - Async/sync support
   - ✅ WORKING

3. **`app/Shared/Events/EventBus.php`** (240 lines)
   - Central event management system
   - Synchronous listener execution
   - Asynchronous listener queueing
   - Priority-based execution order
   - Event history tracking
   - Bus statistics and monitoring
   - ✅ TESTED AND WORKING

4. **`app/Jobs/ProcessDomainEvent.php`** (119 lines)
   - Background job for async event processing
   - Exponential backoff retry strategy (1min, 2min, 4min)
   - Max 3 retry attempts
   - Failed event logging
   - ✅ WORKING

5. **`app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`** - UPDATED
   - Registered EventBus as singleton
   - ✅ WORKING

### 3. Verification Tests (100%)
```
✅ EventBus loads correctly
✅ Domain events work
✅ Event serialization works
✅ Bus statistics functional
✅ All components initialized
```

## 📊 Current State vs. Target

### Before Phase 5
```
Services: 130+ scattered across 20+ directories
Communication: Direct service-to-service calls
Coupling: Tightly coupled services
Testing: Difficult to test in isolation
Features: Requires modifying multiple services
```

### After Phase 5 (Target)
```
Services: 50-60 organized in 7 domains
Communication: Event-driven via EventBus
Coupling: Loosely coupled via events
Testing: Each domain tested independently
Features: Add by creating event listeners
```

### Current Progress (40%)
```
Services: Still 130+, but infrastructure ready for reorganization
Communication: EventBus created, ready for event publishing
Coupling: Infrastructure in place, migration pending
Testing: Event tests passing, domain tests pending
Features: Event system operational, listeners to be created
```

## 🔄 Next Steps (60% Remaining)

### Phase 5.1: Domain Directory Structure (Next)
```
Create app/Domains/ with 7 domains:
├── Appointments/
├── Availability/
├── Customers/
├── Notifications/
├── VoiceAI/
├── CalendarSync/
└── Resilience/
```

### Phase 5.2: Define Domain Events
```
Create event classes for each domain:
- AppointmentCreatedEvent
- AppointmentCancelledEvent
- CustomerIdentifiedEvent
- AvailabilityChangedEvent
- CallStartedEvent
- CalcomBookingCreatedEvent
... and 20+ more
```

### Phase 5.3: Create Event Listeners
```
Create listeners to handle events:
- SendConfirmationEmailListener
- CalcomSyncListener
- CacheInvalidationListener
- AnalyticsEventListener
- AuditEventListener
... and more
```

### Phase 5.4: Migrate Critical Services
```
Move services to domain structure:
- AppointmentCreationService → Appointments domain
- AvailabilityService → Availability domain
- NotificationService → Notifications domain
... etc
```

### Phase 5.5: Add Event Publishing
```
Update services to publish events:
- AppointmentCreationService publishes AppointmentCreatedEvent
- CalcomService publishes CalcomBookingCreatedEvent
- NotificationService listens to events and sends notifications
```

## 📈 Architecture Improvements

### Code Organization
```
Before: app/Services/ with 130+ scattered files
After:  app/Domains/ with 7 organized domains
```

### Service Communication
```
Before: Service A → Service B → Service C (tight coupling)
After:  Service A publishes event → EventBus → All subscribers (loose coupling)
```

### Testing
```
Before: Must test entire flow from UI to database
After:  Test each domain independently, mock EventBus
```

### Feature Development
```
Before: Add feature → modify multiple services
After:  Add event listener → done
```
