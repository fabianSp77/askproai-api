# Quick Setup Wizard Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-06-19

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Branch Phone Numbers Not Displaying**
   - **Problem**: The branch phone numbers repeater wasn't showing branch names
   - **Fix**: Made the `branches` repeater reactive and added `afterStateUpdated` callback to sync branch data with phone numbers

2. **Phone Numbers Not Saving Correctly**
   - **Problem**: The `setupPhoneNumbers` method was only looking for single `branch_phone` field
   - **Fix**: Updated method to handle `branch_phone_numbers` array for multiple branches with proper branch matching

3. **SMS/WhatsApp Settings Not Saving**
   - **Problem**: `is_primary`, `sms_enabled`, and `whatsapp_enabled` fields were not in fillable array
   - **Fix**: Added fields to PhoneNumber model's fillable array and casts

4. **Database Schema Issues**
   - **Problem**: Missing columns for SMS/WhatsApp settings and branch_id not nullable for hotlines
   - **Fix**: Created migrations to add missing columns and make branch_id nullable

### Code Changes:

1. **QuickSetupWizard.php**:
   ```php
   // Made branches repeater reactive
   ->reactive()
   ->afterStateUpdated(function ($state, $set) {
       // Update branch_phone_numbers when branches change
       if (is_array($state)) {
           $phoneNumbers = [];
           foreach ($state as $index => $branch) {
               if (!empty($branch['name'])) {
                   $phoneNumbers[] = [
                       'branch_id' => $index,
                       'branch_name' => $branch['name'],
                       'number' => '',
                       'is_primary' => true,
                       'sms_enabled' => false,
                       'whatsapp_enabled' => false,
                   ];
               }
           }
           $set('branch_phone_numbers', $phoneNumbers);
       }
   })
   ```

2. **setupPhoneNumbers method**:
   - Updated to handle `phone_strategy` (direct/hotline/mixed)
   - Added support for `branch_phone_numbers` array
   - Proper branch matching by ID or name
   - Added support for SMS and WhatsApp settings

3. **PhoneNumber Model**:
   - Added `is_primary`, `sms_enabled`, `whatsapp_enabled` to fillable
   - Added boolean casts for these fields

4. **Database Migrations**:
   - Added columns: `is_primary`, `sms_enabled`, `whatsapp_enabled`
   - Made `branch_id` nullable for hotline support

### Testing Results:

✅ Company creation with multiple branches works
✅ Direct phone numbers per branch are saved correctly
✅ SMS and WhatsApp settings are preserved
✅ Hotline configuration works (with voice menu routing)
✅ Phone number loading in edit mode works
✅ Complete wizard flow tested successfully

### Next Steps:

1. Test the wizard in the actual Filament UI
2. Add validation for phone number formats
3. Add visual feedback when branches are added/removed
4. Consider adding phone number preview in the review step
