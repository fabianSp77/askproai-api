# Operations Center Fix Report
## Date: 2025-08-01
## Issue: #467 - Dropdowns won't close, links not clickable

### Problem Summary
The Operations Center had critical issues:
1. **Alpine.js Errors**: `dateFilterDropdownEnhanced is not defined` and `showDateFilter is not defined`
2. **Dropdowns**: Would not close after opening
3. **Links**: Not clickable due to pointer-events issues
4. **Script Conflicts**: Multiple menu management scripts competing

### Root Causes
1. **Missing Alpine Components**: The page used `x-data="dateFilterDropdownEnhanced()"` and `x-data="companyBranchSelect()"` but these components were never defined
2. **Script Conflicts**: Three different menu/dropdown scripts running simultaneously:
   - `filament-menu-clean.js`
   - `menu-cleanup.js`  
   - `admin-dropdown-fix.js`
3. **Pointer Events**: Links had `pointer-events: none` preventing clicks

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. Created Missing Alpine Components
Created `/public/js/operations-center-fix.js` with:
- `companyBranchSelect()` - Handles company/branch filter dropdown
- `dateFilterDropdownEnhanced()` - Handles date filter dropdown
- Both components include:
  - Proper open/close functionality
  - Click outside to close
  - Escape key support
  - Search functionality
  - Livewire integration

#### 2. Fixed Script Conflicts
- Disabled conflicting scripts in `base.blade.php`:
  - ❌ `filament-menu-clean.js`
  - ❌ `menu-cleanup.js`
- Kept only:
  - ✅ `admin-dropdown-fix.js` (handles all dropdown functionality)

#### 3. Fixed Pointer Events
The `operations-center-fix.js` includes:
- Forces `pointer-events: auto` on all links and buttons
- Removes blocking overlays
- Re-applies fixes after Livewire updates
- DOM mutation observer for dynamic content

### Files Modified
1. `/resources/views/filament/admin/pages/operations-dashboard.blade.php`
   - Added script inclusion for operations-center-fix.js
2. `/public/js/operations-center-fix.js` (new file)
   - Defines missing Alpine components
   - Fixes pointer events for links
3. `/resources/views/vendor/filament-panels/components/layout/base.blade.php`
   - Disabled conflicting menu scripts

### Testing
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Visit Operations Center
3. Test:
   - Company/Branch dropdown opens and closes
   - Date filter dropdown works
   - All links are clickable
   - Only one dropdown open at a time
   - No console errors

### Console Output (Expected)
```
[AdminDropdownFix] Dropdown fixes loaded successfully
[Operations Center Fix] Initializing missing components...
[Operations Center Fix] Components registered successfully
[Operations Center Fix] Fixing pointer events...
[Operations Center Fix] All fixes loaded
```

### Monitoring
Watch for:
- Alpine expression errors in console
- Dropdowns that don't close
- Links that aren't clickable
- Any new script conflicts
