# References to Deleted Pages - Search Results

## Summary of Found References

### 1. **DashboardRouteResolver.php** (`/app/Services/DashboardRouteResolver.php`)
- Line 23: `'dashboard' => 'OperationsDashboard',` 
- This maps the 'dashboard' slug to OperationsDashboard (not the deleted Dashboard.php)
- No action needed as it references OperationsDashboard which still exists

### 2. **QuickActionsWidget.php** (`/app/Filament/Admin/Widgets/QuickActionsWidget.php`)
- Line 48: `'url' => '/admin/system-status',`
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: This hardcoded URL points to the deleted SystemStatus page
- This will cause a 404 error when users click the "System Status" quick action

### 3. **AdminPanelProvider.php** (`/app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php`)
- No direct references found to deleted pages
- Uses auto-discovery for pages, so deleted pages are automatically removed

### 4. **No References Found For:**
- Dashboard.php
- OperationalDashboard.php (except in DashboardRouteResolver which maps to OptimizedOperationalDashboard)
- BasicSystemStatus.php
- SystemHealthSimple.php
- SimpleCompanyIntegrationPortal.php
- ErrorFallback.php
- RetellAgentEditor.php
- SetupSuccessPage.php

## Required Actions

### 1. Fix QuickActionsWidget.php
The widget contains a hardcoded link to `/admin/system-status` which no longer exists.

**Options:**
- Remove the System Status action from the widget
- Replace with a link to an existing page like `/admin/system-monitoring` or `/admin/system-health-basic`
- Update the URL to point to a different monitoring page

### 2. Verify Routes
No route definitions were found for the deleted pages, which is good. The Filament auto-discovery should handle the removal cleanly.

### 3. Check Frontend References
Some blade files might contain references, but most appear to be for different dashboards that still exist.

## Conclusion

Only one critical reference was found that needs to be fixed:
- **QuickActionsWidget.php** line 48 has a hardcoded URL to the deleted system-status page

All other references appear to be clean or reference pages that still exist.
