    - Significant drops (<20% of average)
    - Geographic pattern changes
  - **Business Anomalies**:
    - High no-show rates (>20%)
    - Bulk booking patterns
    - Inactive companies
  - **Company-Specific Issues**:
    - High call failure rates
    - Performance degradation
- **Machine Learning Concepts**:
  - Historical pattern analysis
  - Time-based pattern deviation

  - Severity scoring system
- **Smart Recommendations**:
  - Auto-generated action items
  - Priority-based suggestions
  - Step-by-step remediation

## Visual Enhancements

### Glassmorphism Design
- Semi-transparent cards with backdrop blur
- Neon glow effects (green, yellow, red, blue)
- Shimmer animations on health bars
- Pulse animations for critical metrics

### Interactive Elements
- Hover effects with scaling
- Smooth transitions
- Click interactions for drill-downs
- Fullscreen mode toggle
- Auto-refresh toggle with visual indicator

### Responsive Layout
- Grid-based responsive design
- Mobile-optimized views
- Flexible chart containers
- Adaptive 3D visualization

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- 5-second cache for system metrics
- 30-second cache for company metrics
- 5-minute cache for historical data
- 1-hour cache for anomaly patterns

### Efficient Updates
- Batch data loading
- WebSocket for targeted updates
- Lazy loading for drill-down data
- Optimized database queries with eager loading

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
```env
# Broadcasting
BROADCAST_CONNECTION=pusher
PUSHER_APP_ID=your_app_id
PUSHER_APP_KEY=your_app_key
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=your_app_secret
PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=mt1

# Redis (for real-time features)
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

### Scheduler Setup
Add to cron:
```bash
* * * * * cd /var/www/api-gateway && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

## Usage Instructions

### Accessing the Dashboard
1. Navigate to `/admin/ultimate-system-cockpit`
2. Dashboard loads with real-time data
3. WebSocket connection established automatically

### Interacting with Features
- **3D Globe**: Click and drag to rotate, scroll to zoom
- **Company Cards**: Click to view detailed information
- **Charts**: Hover for detailed tooltips
- **Anomaly Alerts**: Click for recommendations
- **Controls**: Bottom-right buttons for refresh and fullscreen

### Monitoring Anomalies
- Anomalies appear at top of dashboard
- Color-coded by severity (red/yellow/blue)
- Each includes timestamp and recommendations
- System automatically detects patterns

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- Alpine.js for reactive UI
- Three.js for 3D visualization
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Laravel Echo for WebSocket
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Backend Components
- Livewire component for data management
- Event broadcasting system
- Anomaly detection service
- Real-time metrics calculation
- Smart caching layer

### Data Flow
1. Metrics calculated every 10 seconds
2. Broadcast via WebSocket
3. Frontend receives updates
4. UI updates without refresh
5. Anomalies detected and displayed

## Future Enhancement Ideas
1. Machine learning model training for better anomaly detection
2. Predictive analytics for capacity planning
3. Custom alert configurations per company
4. Export functionality for reports
5. Integration with external monitoring tools
6. Voice alerts for critical anomalies
7. AR/VR visualization options

## Troubleshooting

### WebSocket Not Connecting
- Check Pusher credentials in .env
- Verify firewall allows WebSocket connections
- Check browser console for errors

### 3D Globe Not Rendering
