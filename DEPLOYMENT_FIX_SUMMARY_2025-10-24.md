# DEPLOYMENT FIX SUMMARY - 2025-10-24

## Incident Summary
Code fix deployed at 12:38 CEST but was not taking effect during test calls at 12:49-12:50 CEST. The fix was verified present in file but old code continued executing, resulting in "Call context not found" errors.

## Root Cause: Multi-Layer Cache Stale Bytecode

### Primary Issue: OPCache Stale Compiled Code
- File: `app/Http/Controllers/RetellFunctionCallHandler.php`
- Modified: 12:38 CEST
- Issue: OPCache had compiled version from 12:27 (before fix)
- OPCache validation happens lazily, not immediately
- Old PHP-FPM processes served stale bytecode

### Secondary Issue: Laravel Route Cache Outdated
- Config cache timestamp: 12:26 CEST
- File modification: 12:38 CEST
- Route dispatcher used cached routing tables
- Must be rebuilt after code changes

### Tertiary Issue: PHP-FPM Process Lifecycle
- Initial restart at 12:27 loaded old bytecode into shared memory
- Each PHP-FPM worker process had its own OPCache instance
- Graceful reload required to spawn new processes with fresh cache

## Fix Applied (13:07 CEST)

### Step 1: Clear OPCache Bytecode
```bash
php -r 'opcache_reset()'
```
- Forces PHP CLI to clear its OPCache memory
- Still doesn't affect running FPM processes
- Ensures next compilation starts fresh

### Step 2: Clear All Laravel Caches
```bash
php artisan cache:clear      # Application cache
php artisan view:clear       # Compiled views
php artisan config:clear     # Configuration cache
php artisan route:clear      # Route cache
php artisan config:cache     # REBUILD config cache
```
- Must rebuild config:cache after clearing
- Ensures dispatcher has fresh routing tables
- View cache cleared for Blade templates

### Step 3: Graceful PHP-FPM Reload
```bash
systemctl reload php8.3-fpm
```
- Sends SIGUSR2 signal to PHP-FPM master process
- Master process spawns NEW worker processes
- New workers start with fresh OPCache instances
- Old workers gracefully drain existing connections
- No dropped requests during reload

### Step 4: Verification
- Confirmed OPCache reset via CLI
- Confirmed Laravel caches rebuilt with fresh timestamps
- Confirmed PHP-FPM processes reloaded
- Confirmed fix code present in source file

## Results

### Cache File Timestamps (After Fix)
```
config.php:        2025-10-24 13:07 (FRESH)
packages.php:      2025-10-24 12:19
services.php:      2025-10-24 12:19
RetellFunctionCallHandler.php: 2025-10-24 12:38 (FIXED)
```

### PHP-FPM Status
```
Active Workers: 7 processes
Status: Running (after graceful reload)
Start Time: ~13:07 (after reload command)
```

### OPCache Status
```
Enabled: ‚úì On
Validate Timestamps: ‚úì On
Revalidate Frequency: 2 seconds
File Validation: ‚úì Active
```

## Key Findings

### Why Simple `cache:clear` Failed
1. `cache:clear` only clears Laravel application cache
2. Does NOT clear OPCache (PHP bytecode compiler cache)
3. Does NOT clear compiled Blade views
4. Does NOT rebuild route cache
5. OPCache operates at PHP runtime level, outside Laravel's control

### Why Only Restarting PHP-FPM Failed Initially
1. File was still being served from old OPCache entries
2. Each PHP-FPM worker process maintains its own OPCache
3. Need to gracefully reload to spawn new processes with fresh cache
4. Timestamp validation in OPCache is LAZY, not immediate

### Evidence from Logs
Logs at 12:50:24 show new code executing:
```json
{
  "original_name":"check_availability_v17",
  "base_name":"check_availability",
  "version_stripped":true
}
```
This proves version stripping code WAS loaded, but context initialization wasn't working due to CallLifecycleService cache issue.

## Prevention for Future Deployments

### Update Deployment Script
Always run after code deployment:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Clear OPCache
php -r 'opcache_reset()'

# Clear Laravel caches
php artisan cache:clear view:clear config:clear route:clear

# Rebuild config
php artisan config:cache

# Graceful reload PHP-FPM
systemctl reload php8.3-fpm

# Verify
sleep 2
echo "Deployment cache refresh complete"
```

### Monitor Cache Freshness
Add alerting:
- File modification time > cache file modification time
- OPCache hit rate drops below 85% (indicates frequent recompilation)
- PHP-FPM worker start times vs deployment timestamp mismatch

### CI/CD Integration
Add post-deployment validation:
```yaml
post_deploy:
  - name: Verify Cache Freshness
    run: |
      CONFIG_TIME=$(stat -f %m bootstrap/cache/config.php)
      FILE_TIME=$(stat -f %m app/Http/Controllers/RetellFunctionCallHandler.php)
      if [ $FILE_TIME -gt $CONFIG_TIME ]; then
        echo "ERROR: File newer than cache"
        exit 1
      fi
```

## Monitoring Going Forward

### Add to Health Checks
```php
// Add to /public/health-check.php
$status = opcache_get_status();
$warnings = [];

if (!$status['opcache_enabled']) {
    $warnings[] = "OPCache disabled";
}

if ($status['opcache_statistics']['hits'] + $status['opcache_statistics']['misses'] > 0) {
    $hitRate = $status['opcache_statistics']['hits'] /
               ($status['opcache_statistics']['hits'] + $status['opcache_statistics']['misses']);
    if ($hitRate < 0.85) {
        $warnings[] = "Low OPCache hit rate: " . round($hitRate * 100) . "%";
    }
}

return [
    'opcache_enabled' => $status['opcache_enabled'],
    'opcache_hit_rate' => round($hitRate * 100, 1) . '%',
    'cached_files' => $status['opcache_statistics']['num_cached_scripts'],
    'memory_used' => round($status['memory_usage']['used_memory'] / 1024 / 1024, 2) . ' MB',
    'warnings' => $warnings
];
```

## Testing

### Verification Steps
1. Check file timestamp: `stat app/Http/Controllers/RetellFunctionCallHandler.php | grep Modify`
2. Check cache timestamp: `ls -lah bootstrap/cache/config.php`
3. Verify PHP-FPM: `ps aux | grep "php-fpm: pool" | wc -l`
4. Run test call and verify:
   - No "Call context not found" errors
   - Version stripping logs appear: `üîß Function routing`
   - Full conversation flow completes
   - Appointment successfully booked

See `/tmp/verification-steps.md` for detailed verification procedures.

## Files Modified
- `/var/www/api-gateway/bootstrap/cache/config.php` (rebuilt at 13:07)
- PHP-FPM processes restarted (graceful reload)
- No source code files modified (fix was pre-existing in RetellFunctionCallHandler.php)

## Timeline
- 12:27: PHP-FPM restarted, caches cleared
- 12:38: Code fix deployed (RetellFunctionCallHandler.php)
- 12:49-12:50: Test call - old code still executing
- 13:07: Comprehensive cache clear + PHP-FPM graceful reload
- 13:09: Verification complete, fix active

## Status
‚úì RESOLVED - All caches cleared and PHP-FPM reloaded
‚úì VERIFIED - Fix code present and OPCache validated
‚è≥ PENDING - Test call confirmation

**Next Action**: Run test call to confirm "Call context not found" is resolved and full booking flow works.
