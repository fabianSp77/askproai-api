php artisan improvement:analyze --report
```

## MCP Relevance Scoring

The system evaluates MCPs based on:

### Priority Categories (40% weight)
- Calendar/Scheduling
- Appointment/Booking
- Telephony/Voice
- AI/Conversation

### Secondary Categories (30% weight)
- CRM/Customer
- Business/Automation
- Monitoring/Analytics
- Performance

### Keywords (20% weight)
- High Priority: laravel, filament, calcom, retell, german, gdpr
- Medium Priority: php, mysql, webhook, multi-tenant, saas

### Popularity & Maintenance (10% weight)
- GitHub stars
- NPM downloads
- Last update date

## Deployment Safety Features

### Pre-Deployment Checks
1. **Database Connectivity** - Ensures database is accessible
2. **Pending Migrations** - Identifies migrations to run
3. **Test Suite** - Runs all tests
4. **Disk Space** - Verifies sufficient space
5. **External Services** - Checks Cal.com, Retell.ai availability

### Zero-Downtime Strategy
1. **Blue-Green Deployment**
   - Deploy to inactive environment
   - Run health checks
   - Switch traffic atomically
   
2. **Rolling Deployment**
   - Update instances gradually
   - Monitor each instance
   - Automatic rollback on failure

### Rollback Mechanism
- Automatic database backup before deployment
- Code snapshot creation
- Configuration preservation
- One-command rollback: `php artisan deploy:rollback`

## Continuous Improvement Metrics

### Performance Tracking
- Response times (API, Web, Database)
- Throughput (requests/second)
- Error rates
- Resource utilization

### Bottleneck Detection
- **Database**: Slow queries, lock waits, connection exhaustion
- **API**: High latency, timeouts, error spikes
- **Queue**: Processing delays, growing backlogs
- **Resources**: CPU/Memory/Disk constraints

### Optimization Types
1. **Query Optimization**
   - Missing index detection
   - N+1 query identification
   - Query rewriting suggestions

2. **Cache Optimization**
   - Hit rate improvement
   - Cache warming strategies
   - TTL optimization

3. **Architecture Optimization**
   - Horizontal scaling recommendations
   - Service decomposition
   - Load balancing improvements

## Integration with AskProAI

### Automatic Scheduling
```yaml
# config/schedule.php
$schedule->command('mcp:discover')->daily();
$schedule->command('uiux:analyze')->weekly();
$schedule->command('improvement:analyze')->hourly();
```

### Dashboard Integration
Access real-time metrics at: `/admin/system-improvements`

### Notification Channels
- Slack webhooks for critical alerts
- Email summaries for weekly reports
- Dashboard notifications for new discoveries

## Best Practices

### MCP Discovery
1. Review discovered MCPs weekly
2. Test in staging before production
3. Document integration decisions
4. Monitor MCP performance impact

### UI/UX Improvements
1. Implement high-priority suggestions first
2. A/B test major UI changes
3. Monitor user feedback
4. Maintain accessibility standards

### Deployments
1. Always deploy during low-traffic periods
2. Monitor for 15 minutes post-deployment
3. Keep rollback scripts updated
4. Document deployment decisions

### Continuous Improvement
1. Review recommendations weekly
2. Prioritize based on impact vs effort
3. Test optimizations in staging
4. Monitor optimization results

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Discovery Issues
```bash
# Clear discovery cache
php artisan cache:clear --tags=mcp-discovery

# Re-scan all sources
php artisan mcp:discover --force

# Check discovery logs
tail -f storage/logs/mcp-discovery.log
```

### Deployment Failures
```bash
# Check deployment status
php artisan deploy:status

# View deployment logs
tail -f storage/logs/deployment.log

# Manual rollback
php artisan deploy:rollback --deployment-id=xxx
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Run immediate analysis
php artisan improvement:analyze --module=performance

# Check bottleneck details
php artisan improvement:bottlenecks --verbose

# Export metrics for analysis
php artisan improvement:export --format=csv
```

## Security Considerations

   - Code review required for auto-installations
   - Sandboxed testing environment

2. **Deployment Security**
   - Encrypted backups
   - Secure credential handling
   - Audit trail for all deployments

3. **Data Protection**
   - GDPR compliance maintained
   - No customer data in improvement metrics
   - Anonymized performance tracking

## Future Enhancements

1. **AI-Powered Optimization**
   - Machine learning for pattern detection
   - Predictive optimization timing
   - Automated A/B testing

2. **Advanced MCP Integration**
