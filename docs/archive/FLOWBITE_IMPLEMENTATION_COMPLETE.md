```

### Key Design Patterns Used

1. **Consistent Headers**
   - All resources use similar header structures
   - Status badges positioned consistently
   - Avatar/icon patterns unified

2. **Grid Layouts**
   - Responsive breakpoints (sm/md/lg)
   - 1-3-2 column layouts for detail pages
   - Card-based information architecture

3. **Color System**
   - Status colors: green (active), red (inactive), yellow (warning)
   - Gradients for emphasis: blue-purple, indigo-purple
   - Dark mode with gray-800 backgrounds

4. **Interactive Elements**
   - Hover states on all clickable elements
   - Loading states for async operations
   - Toast notifications for actions

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### Vite Configuration
```javascript
// vite.config.js
input: [
    'resources/css/flowbite-pro.css',
    'resources/js/flowbite.js',
    'resources/js/flowbite-alpine.js',
    'resources/js/flowbite-init.js',
]
```

### Service Provider
```php
// FlowbiteServiceProvider.php
- Asset existence checks
- Conditional registration
- Filament package integration
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**
   - Images loaded on demand
   - Pagination for long lists
   - Limit queries (e.g., ->limit(5))

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Eager loading with with() methods
   - Aggregation queries for stats
   - Indexed column usage

3. **Asset Optimization**
   - Minified CSS/JS in production
   - Tree-shaking unused components
   - CDN-ready asset structure

## 📝 Usage Instructions

### For Developers

1. **Adding New Views:**
   ```blade
   @extends('filament::layouts.app')
   @section('content')
   <div class="p-6">
       <!-- Flowbite components here -->
   </div>
   @endsection
   ```

2. **Using Components:**
   - Cards: `<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-sm">`
   - Badges: `<span class="inline-flex items-center px-3 py-1 rounded-full">`
   - Stats: Grid with icon boxes
   - Timelines: Flow-root with relative positioning

3. **Dark Mode:**
   - Always include both light and dark classes
   - Example: `text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100`

### For Resource Configuration

To enable custom views in Filament resources:

```php
// In your Resource class
public static function getPages(): array
{
    return [
        'view' => Pages\ViewRecord::route('/{record}'),
    ];
}

// In ViewRecord page class
protected static string $view = 'filament.admin.resources.your-resource.view';
```
