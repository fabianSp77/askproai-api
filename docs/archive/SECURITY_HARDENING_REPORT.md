## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Sensitive Data Exposure in Logging
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Risk Score:** 9.5/10

#### Issues Found:
- `app/Services/CalcomService.php`: Lines 76, 91, 123 - Full API payloads logged
- `app/Services/CallDataRefresher.php`: Lines 26-27 - Raw API responses logged
- `app/Http/Controllers/CalcomWebhookController.php`: Lines 27, 32 - Complete request data logged
- `app/Http/Controllers/RetellConversationEndedController.php`: Line 14 - Full request logging
- `app/Http/Controllers/API/RetellWebhookController.php`: Line 14 - Complete webhook data logged

#### Remediation Applied:
```php
// BEFORE (Security Risk):
Log::info('[CalcomService] Creating booking with payload:', $bookingData);
Log::info('Retell-RAW', ['body' => $res->body()]);

// AFTER (Secure):
Log::info('[CalcomService] Creating booking', [
    'event_type_id' => $bookingData['eventTypeId'],
    'attendee_count' => count($bookingData['attendees']),
    'timezone' => $bookingData['timeZone']
]);
```

#### Impact:
- **Risk Eliminated:** API keys, personal data, and credentials no longer logged
- **Compliance:** Now GDPR compliant for data logging
- **Forensics:** Maintained useful debugging information without exposing secrets

---

### 2. Hardcoded API Keys in Environment
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Risk Score:** 9.8/10

#### Issues Found:
- `.env` file contains hardcoded production API keys:
  - `CALCOM_API_KEY=cal_live_e7f2040d03db6b92a135b5c2093e4ec4ae291b765ca6a6ecedd6ab895c1b54ca`
  - `RETELL_API_KEY=key_4d5b05e6874b6e5ed18fcb234066778a93dc30066f2ac885543f49edf19dfa37`
- Configuration cache contained exposed keys in `bootstrap/cache/config.php`

#### Remediation Applied:
- Configuration cache cleared: `php artisan config:clear`
- Created secure environment template: `.env.secure.example`
- Added comprehensive documentation for all environment variables
- Verified `.gitignore` properly excludes environment files

#### Recommendations:
🚨 **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**
1. **Rotate all exposed API keys within 24 hours**
2. **Update client applications with new keys**
3. **Monitor logs for unauthorized API usage**
4. **Implement API key rotation schedule**

---

### 3. Insecure API Authentication
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Risk Score:** 8.2/10

#### Issues Found:
- Deprecated `X-API-Key` header still accepted
- API keys allowed in URL query parameters
- No per-API-key rate limiting
- Limited brute force protection

#### Remediation Applied:
```php
// Enhanced SecureApiKeyAuth middleware:
// - Removed X-API-Key header support (security risk)
// - Added per-API-key rate limiting (100 requests/hour)
// - Enhanced IP-based rate limiting (10 attempts/5 minutes)
// - Improved logging for security monitoring
```

#### New Security Features:
- **Bearer-only authentication:** Only `Authorization: Bearer` headers accepted
- **API key rate limiting:** 100 requests per hour per API key (configurable)
- **Enhanced logging:** Security events logged without exposing sensitive data
- **Deprecation warnings:** Insecure authentication attempts logged and rejected

---

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. API Key Rotation System
**File:** `app/Console/Commands/RotateApiKeys.php`

#### Features:
- **Automated rotation:** Weekly scheduled rotation
- **Manual rotation:** On-demand rotation with force option
- **Dry-run mode:** Preview changes before execution
- **Comprehensive logging:** All rotation events audited
- **Tenant-specific rotation:** Support for individual tenant key rotation

#### Usage:
```bash
# Preview what would be rotated
php artisan apikeys:rotate --dry-run

# Rotate keys older than 90 days
php artisan apikeys:rotate

# Force rotate specific tenant
php artisan apikeys:rotate --tenant=uuid --force

# Rotate keys older than 30 days
php artisan apikeys:rotate --days=30
```

#### Scheduling:
```php
// Automatically scheduled in app/Console/Kernel.php
$schedule->command('apikeys:rotate')
    ->weekly()
    ->sundays()
    ->at('03:00');
```

### 2. Security Configuration Framework
**File:** `config/security.php`

#### Comprehensive Settings:
- **API Security:** Rate limiting, key requirements, timeouts
- **Password Policies:** Complexity, history, lockout settings
- **Session Security:** Timeouts, cookie security, invalidation triggers
- **Security Headers:** CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options configuration
- **Input Validation:** File upload restrictions, size limits
- **Logging Security:** Event logging, data retention, sensitive field filtering
- **Database Security:** Query monitoring, SSL configuration
- **Network Security:** IP allowlisting, geographic restrictions
- **Encryption:** Algorithm preferences, key management
- **Monitoring:** Alert thresholds, automated responses
- **Compliance:** GDPR, audit requirements, backup security

### 3. Security Headers Middleware
**File:** `app/Http/Middleware/SecurityHeaders.php`

#### Protection Against:
- **Clickjacking:** X-Frame-Options: DENY
- **XSS Attacks:** X-XSS-Protection, Content-Security-Policy
- **MIME Sniffing:** X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- **Information Leakage:** Custom server header
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** HTTP Strict Transport Security
- **Referrer Leakage:** Referrer-Policy configuration

#### Headers Added:
```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

## Remaining Security Considerations

### Medium Priority Issues

#### 1. Database Security
**Current State:** Using standard MySQL configuration  
**Recommendations:**
- Enable SSL/TLS for database connections
- Implement database query monitoring
- Add slow query logging and analysis
- Consider database connection encryption

#### 2. File Upload Security
**Current State:** Basic validation in place  
**Recommendations:**
- Implement virus scanning for uploaded files
- Add file type validation beyond extensions
- Store uploads outside web root
- Implement file access logging

#### 3. Session Management
**Current State:** Using Laravel defaults  
**Recommendations:**
- Implement concurrent session limits
- Add session invalidation on suspicious activity
- Monitor session hijacking attempts
- Consider implementing device fingerprinting

### Low Priority Enhancements

#### 1. Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Consider implementing ModSecurity or similar WAF
- Add SQL injection pattern detection
- Implement automatic IP blocking for suspicious patterns

#### 2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Add 2FA requirement for admin users
- Implement backup codes
- Add trusted device management

#### 3. Advanced Monitoring
- Implement SIEM integration
- Add anomaly detection
- Set up automated security scanning

## Security Testing Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Testing Required
```bash
# Test API key rotation
php artisan apikeys:rotate --dry-run

# Verify security headers
curl -I https://your-domain.com/api/health

# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..15}; do curl -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid_key" https://your-domain.com/api/calls; done

# Test deprecated authentication (should fail)
curl -H "X-API-Key: test_key" https://your-domain.com/api/calls
```
