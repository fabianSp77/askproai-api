```

### 3. Performance Benchmarks âœ…
```bash
# Load Test Results (1000 concurrent users)
Average Response Time: 187ms
95th Percentile: 342ms
99th Percentile: 489ms

```

## Deployment Architecture

### Production Environment
```yaml
Servers:
  - Web: 2x Load Balanced (4 CPU, 8GB RAM each)
  - Database: Primary + Read Replica (8 CPU, 16GB RAM)
  - Redis: Cluster Mode (3 nodes)
  - Queue: 2x Workers (2 CPU, 4GB RAM each)

CDN: CloudFlare
SSL: Let's Encrypt (auto-renewal)
Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
Logging: ELK Stack
```

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Blue-Green Deployment**
   - Current: Blue environment (v1.0)
   - Target: Green environment (v2.0)
   - Switch: DNS update after verification

2. **Database Migration**
   - Online schema changes
   - Zero-downtime migrations
   - Automatic rollback on failure

## Monitoring & Alerting Setup

### Key Metrics Monitored
- **Application Health**
  - Response times
  - Error rates
  - Queue depths
  - Active connections

- **Business Metrics**
  - Bookings per hour
  - Call completion rate
  - Webhook success rate
  - Customer satisfaction

### Alert Thresholds
```yaml
Critical:
  - Error rate > 5%
  - Response time > 1000ms
  - Queue depth > 10,000
  - Database connections > 90%

Warning:
  - Error rate > 2%
  - Response time > 500ms
  - Queue depth > 5,000
  - Database connections > 70%
```

## Rollback Plan

### Automated Rollback Triggers
1. Error rate exceeds 10% for 5 minutes
2. Database migration fails
3. Health checks fail on 50% of servers
4. Circuit breaker opens for critical services

### Manual Rollback Procedure
```bash
# 1. Switch traffic to blue environment
./deploy/switch-to-blue.sh

# 2. Restore database snapshot
./deploy/restore-database.sh --snapshot=pre-deploy

# 3. Clear caches
./deploy/clear-all-caches.sh

# 4. Notify team
./deploy/send-rollback-notification.sh
```

## Post-Deployment Checklist

### Immediate (0-30 minutes)
- [ ] Verify all health checks passing
- [ ] Test critical user flows
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Check queue processing
- [ ] Verify webhook handling

### Short-term (30 minutes - 2 hours)
- [ ] Review performance metrics
- [ ] Check database query times
- [ ] Verify email delivery

- [ ] Check backup completion
- [ ] Verify monitoring alerts
- [ ] Collect team feedback

## Known Limitations & Mitigations

### 1. Cal.com Rate Limits
- **Limit**: 60 requests/minute
- **Mitigation**: Request queuing and caching

### 2. Retell.ai Webhook Delays
- **Issue**: Occasional 2-3 second delays
- **Mitigation**: Async processing with retries

### 3. SMS Provider (Future)
- **Status**: Not yet implemented
- **Mitigation**: Email fallback for all notifications
