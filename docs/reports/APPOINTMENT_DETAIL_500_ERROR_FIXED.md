# Appointment Detail Page 500 Error - FIXED

## Date: 2025-09-11
## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Problem Summary
The appointment detail page (`/admin/appointments/{id}`) was showing a 500 server error after Cal.com V2 integration updates.

## Root Cause
**Error:** `Method Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry::mono does not exist`

The `mono()` method was called on line 188 of ViewAppointment.php but doesn't exist in Filament v3.

## Solution Applied

### Fixed Code
**File:** `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Filament/Admin/Resources/AppointmentResource/Pages/ViewAppointment.php`
**Line:** 188

Changed from:
```php
Components\TextEntry::make('calcom_booking_uid')
    ->label('Cal.com UID')
    ->copyable()
    ->mono()  // ❌ Method doesn't exist in Filament v3
    ->placeholder('Not from Cal.com'),
```

To:
```php
Components\TextEntry::make('calcom_booking_uid')
    ->label('Cal.com UID')
    ->copyable()
    ->badge()      // ✅ Use badge for visual distinction
    ->color('gray')
    ->placeholder('Not from Cal.com'),
```

## Testing Results
- ✅ No errors in Laravel logs
- ✅ Test script successfully loaded ViewAppointment page
- ✅ Appointment data displays correctly:
  - Cal.com V2 Booking ID: Shows correctly
  - Attendees: Count displays properly
  - Location: Type with emoji icons working

## Verified Working Features

- Appointment detail pages display all Cal.com V2 data:
  - Booking IDs and UIDs
