# Admin Portal Access Complete Fix - Summary

## Date: 2025-07-03

## Original Issue
When clicking on "Astro AI" (Company ID 15) in the Business Portal Admin, the user was redirected to "KrÃ¼ckeberg" (Company ID 1) instead. This occurred because the TenantScope was using the admin user's company_id instead of the target company_id from the session.

## Root Causes
1. TenantScope was not prioritizing admin impersonation session data
2. Portal controllers assumed an authenticated portal user always exists
3. Views directly accessed Auth::guard('portal')->user() without null checks
4. No session persistence after setting admin impersonation data

## Complete List of Fixes

### 1. TenantScope Priority Fix
**File**: `/app/Scopes/TenantScope.php`
- Added priority check for admin impersonation FIRST in getCurrentCompanyId()
- Session admin_impersonation.company_id now takes precedence over all other methods

### 2. PortalAuthenticate Middleware
**File**: `/app/Http/Middleware/PortalAuthenticate.php`
- Fixed "Cannot set company context from web request" error
- Changed from setTrustedCompanyContext() to app()->instance('current_company_id', $companyId)
- Added check for admin viewing to bypass normal authentication

### 3. AdminAccessController
**File**: `/app/Http/Controllers/Portal/AdminAccessController.php`
- Added Auth::guard('portal')->logout() before admin access
- Added Session::save() to persist session data before redirect
- Ensures clean state when admin views company portal

### 4. DashboardController
**File**: `/app/Http/Controllers/Portal/DashboardController.php`
- Added handleAdminViewing() method with anonymous class for dummy user
- Anonymous class implements hasPermission() method returning true for admin
- Check admin viewing FIRST before checking portal user

### 5. Layout Template
**File**: `/resources/views/portal/layouts/app.blade.php`
- Fixed "Attempt to read property 'name' on null" error
- Added conditional check for admin viewing vs portal user
- Shows "Admin Zugriff" when admin is viewing

### 6. CallController
**File**: `/app/Http/Controllers/Portal/CallController.php`
- Made getCallStatistics() accept nullable PortalUser
- Added admin viewing checks to skip permission validations
- Handle null user throughout the controller

### 7. BillingController
**File**: `/app/Http/Controllers/Portal/BillingController.php`
- Added company determination logic for admin viewing
- Pass company object to all views (index, topup, usage)
- Fixed prepareChartData() to handle null user
- Fixed downloadInvoice() to handle admin viewing
- Added admin warning in processTopup() preventing payment processing

### 8. TeamController
**File**: `/app/Http/Controllers/Portal/TeamController.php`
- Made all methods handle nullable user
- Added admin viewing checks throughout
- Fixed sendInvite() to use correct company_id
- Made getAvailableRoles() accept nullable user
- Fixed all self-edit/role-change validations for admin viewing

### 9. Billing Topup View
**File**: `/resources/views/portal/billing/topup.blade.php`
- Changed from Auth::guard('portal')->user()->company to $company
- Added admin warning message about payment restrictions

## Key Implementation Patterns

### 1. Company ID Determination
```php
if (session('is_admin_viewing')) {
    $companyId = session('admin_impersonation.company_id');
    $company = Company::findOrFail($companyId);
} else {
    $company = $user->company;
}
```

### 2. Permission Checks
```php
// Skip permission check for admin viewing
if (!session('is_admin_viewing')) {
    if (!$user || !$user->hasPermission('permission.name')) {
        abort(403);
    }
}
```

### 3. Nullable User Methods
```php
private function someMethod(?PortalUser $user)
{
    // Handle null user case
}
```

### 4. View Data
```php
'canManage' => session('is_admin_viewing') || ($user && $user->hasPermission('team.manage'))
```

## Session Structure
```php
session('is_admin_viewing') => true
session('admin_impersonation') => [
    'company_id' => 15,
    'company_name' => 'Astro AI'
]
session('admin_viewing_company') => 'Astro AI'
```

## Result
Admin can now successfully:
- Click on any company in Business Portal Admin
- View the correct company's portal (no more redirects to wrong company)
- Navigate through all portal pages without authentication errors
- View but not perform sensitive actions (payments, etc.)

## Security Considerations
- Admin can view all data but cannot process payments
- Admin viewing mode clearly indicated in UI
- Original portal user logged out before admin access
- All permission bypasses only apply when is_admin_viewing is true
