# QUICK REFERENCE - Customer View Empty Widget Fix

## The Issue
Empty widget box appearing on customer page #338 (and potentially others).

## The Root Cause
`CustomerDetailStats` widget was passing chart arrays to Filament Stat objects, which Livewire couldn't serialize during component hydration.

## The Fix
Removed 2 chart() method calls from stat objects in `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Filament/Resources/CustomerResource/Widgets/CustomerDetailStats.php`

**Lines Changed**: 85, 94, 107 (3 modifications)
**Total Impact**: 5 lines (2 removed, 1 defensive fix)

## What Changed
```php
// Line 85 - REMOVED: ->chart($this->getCallsChart($customer)),
// Line 94 - REMOVED: ->chart($this->getAppointmentsChart($customer)),
// Line 107 - ADDED: Null-safe check for $lastContactAt format
```

## Deployment
```bash
# Deploy the fix
git pull origin main

# Clear view cache
php artisan view:clear

# Done! No migrations, no restarts needed
```

## Verification
1. Navigate to `/admin/customers/338`
2. Verify widget appears (6 stats visible)
3. Check browser console (F12) - no errors
4. Test with other customers too

## If Issues Occur
```bash
# Revert
git revert 2da4c7ce
git push origin main
php artisan view:clear
```

## Key Points
- ✓ No breaking changes
- ✓ Fully backward compatible
- ✓ All metrics still displayed
- ✓ Just removes chart visualizations
- ✓ Prevents Livewire serialization failure

## Commit Info
- **Hash**: `2da4c7ce`
