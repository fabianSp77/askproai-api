## Migration Notes

### CompanyIntegrationPortal Features
Created migration guide: `COMPANY_INTEGRATION_PORTAL_MIGRATION.md`

Features that should be migrated to QuickSetupWizardV2:
- Integration testing buttons (Cal.com, Retell.ai)
- Sync operations (event types, agents, call import)
- Integration status dashboard

## Current Active Setup Pages
1. **QuickSetupWizardV2** - Main setup wizard
2. **EventTypeImportWizard** - Import event types from Cal.com
3. **StaffEventAssignmentModern** - Manage staff-event assignments
4. **CompanyIntegrationPortal** - Integration testing and sync (should be merged into QuickSetupWizardV2)

## Multi-Tenancy Architecture Confirmed
The system properly supports:
- Multiple companies (tenants)
- Multiple branches per company
- Multiple event types per branch/company
- Staff assignments to specific event types
- Calendar mode inheritance (branch can inherit from company or override)

Nothing is hardcoded - the event type ID (2563193) is configured per company/branch.
