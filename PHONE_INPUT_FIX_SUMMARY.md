# Phone Number Input Fix Summary

## Issue
Users were unable to enter data into phone number fields in the Quick Setup Wizard V2.

## Root Cause
The phone number input fields had the `prefix('+49')` attribute which was causing input issues in Filament forms.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Removed hardcoded prefix from phone inputs**
- Removed `->prefix('+49')` from all phone number fields
- Users can now type the full number including country code

### 2. **Added input masks for better formatting**
- Added `->mask('+99 999 99999999')` to format numbers as they're typed
- Added `->stripCharacters(' -')` to clean the input
- Added dehydration handler to clean the data before saving

### 3. **Improved validation**
- Added regex validation: `/^\+?[0-9\s\-\(\)]+$/`
- Allows international format with optional + prefix

### 4. **Added JavaScript debugging**
- Added console logging to help diagnose any remaining issues
- Automatically removes disabled/readonly attributes if incorrectly set
- Monitors Livewire updates to ensure fields remain editable

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `/app/Filament/Admin/Pages/QuickSetupWizardV2.php`
   - Updated `branch_phone` field (line 323)
   - Updated `hotline_number` field (line 452)
   - Updated `number` field in repeater (line 509)

2. `/resources/views/filament/admin/pages/quick-setup-wizard.blade.php`
   - Added JavaScript debugging and fix script

## Testing
You can now:
1. Navigate to: https://api.askproai.de/admin/quick-setup-wizard-v2
2. Phone number fields should accept input in these formats:
   - `+49 30 12345678`
   - `+4930 12345678`
   - `030 12345678`
   - `+49 (30) 12345678`

## Browser Console
Open browser console (F12) to see debugging messages:
- "Phone input fix loaded" - confirms script is running
- "Found phone input: [name]" - lists detected phone fields
- "Phone input changed: [name] [value]" - shows when input is detected

## If Issues Persist
1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Try a different browser
