# MCP Implementation Complete Report
**Date**: 2025-06-21
**Status**: ✅ Core Implementation Complete

## Executive Summary

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration has been successfully implemented, enabling Claude to directly interact with the AskProAI platform. All core MCP servers are operational and the system is ready for production use.

## What We Accomplished Today

### 1. **Fixed Retell MCP Health Check** ✅

  - `processRefund` - Refund handling
  - `getSubscription` - Subscription details
  - `updateSubscription` - Subscription management
  - `generateReport` - Financial reporting

### 3. **Registered All MCP Services** ✅
- Updated MCPServiceProvider
- Updated MCPOrchestrator
- Added circuit breakers for all services
- All services properly integrated

### 4. **Created Comprehensive Test Suite** ✅
- Built test scripts for all MCP endpoints
- Identified and fixed method signature issues
- Validated all services are working

### 5. **Fixed MCP Method Signatures** ✅
- Updated methods to accept params array
- Fixed CalcomMCPServer methods
- Fixed RetellMCPServer methods
- Ensured consistency across all services

$request = new MCPRequest(
    service: 'retell',
    operation: 'getCallDetails',
    params: ['call_id' => 'call_123'],
    tenantId: 1
);
$response = $orchestrator->route($request);
```
