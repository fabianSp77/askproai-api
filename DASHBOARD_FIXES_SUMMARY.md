# Dashboard Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Route Errors (branches.map, staff.schedule)
**Problem**: ListBranches and ListStaff pages were using deprecated `$this->notify()` method
**Solution**: 
- Replaced with `\Filament\Notifications\Notification::make()` in both files
- These were not actual route errors but notification method issues

### 2. Dashboard White Box Issue
**Problem**: Widgets might have been throwing errors due to null references
**Solution**:
- Added proper null checks in CallAnalyticsWidget
- Fixed property existence checks before accessing query results
- Changed `is_active` to `active` in BranchPerformanceWidget

### 3. Navigation Redirects
**Problem**: Clicking on certain resources redirected to dashboard
**Solution**:
- Cleared all caches including Filament component cache
- Rebuilt Filament assets
- Fixed notification methods that were causing JavaScript errors

## Commands Created

1. **`php artisan askproai:fix-dashboard`**
   - Comprehensive dashboard fix command
   - Clears all caches
   - Checks for configuration issues
   - Use `--check` flag for diagnostic only

2. **`php artisan askproai:test-dashboard`**
   - Tests dashboard accessibility
   - Verifies all widgets can be instantiated
   - Reports any missing widgets or classes

## Key Changes Made

1. **BranchResource/Pages/ListBranches.php**
   - Fixed notification method calls in actions

2. **StaffResource/Pages/ListStaff.php**
   - Fixed notification method calls in actions

3. **CallAnalyticsWidget.php**

- ✓ QuickActionsWidget
- ✓ EnhancedDashboardStats

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify user permissions
3. Check Laravel logs: `tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log`
4. Run diagnostic: `php artisan askproai:test-dashboard`

```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan filament:clear-cached-components
php artisan filament:assets
```
