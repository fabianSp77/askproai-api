### Test Execution
While the current environment has PHPUnit configuration issues, all test files are syntactically correct and ready for execution in a properly configured testing environment.

### Configuration Requirements
The tests expect the following configuration values:
- `retell-mcp.security.mcp_token`
- `retell-mcp.security.rate_limit_per_token`
- `retell-mcp.security.allowed_ips`
- `retell-mcp.security.circuit_breaker_threshold`

### Manual Verification Checklist
When the testing environment is properly configured:

1. **Run Core Tests:** `php artisan test tests/Feature/MCP/RetellMCPEndpointTest.php`
2. **Run Security Tests:** `php artisan test tests/Feature/MCP/RetellMCPSecurityTest.php`
3. **Run Performance Tests:** `php artisan test tests/Feature/MCP/RetellMCPPerformanceTest.php`
4. **Run Circuit Breaker Tests:** `php artisan test tests/Feature/MCP/RetellMCPCircuitBreakerTest.php`
5. **Run Complete Suite:** `php tests/Feature/MCP/RunMCPTestSuite.php all`

## 📈 Performance Expectations

Based on the implemented tests, the MCP endpoint should meet these performance criteria:

- **Response Time:** < 50ms average for simple operations
- **P95 Response Time:** < 200ms for all operations
