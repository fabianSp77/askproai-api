# Quick Setup Wizard V2 Fix Summary - 2025-07-01

## Issue
According to GitHub issue #215, when editing the company "askproai" (ID: 1), the Quick Setup Wizard V2 shows as if nothing has been configured yet, despite having saved data.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing Phone Configuration Fields**: The `getEnhancedPhoneConfigurationFields()` method was incomplete - it only had a stub instead of the full implementation from the original QuickSetupWizard.

2. **Non-existent Method Call**: The code was calling `$this->fillFormFromCompany()` which doesn't exist in the class.

3. **Database Field Mismatch**: The code was looking for `duration_minutes` but the database has `duration` and `default_duration_minutes` fields.

4. **Form Submit Action**: The submit action was using raw HTML instead of Filament's Action component.

5. **Missing Data Fields**: Several data fields were not being loaded in edit mode:
   - `calcom_connection_type`
   - `phone_strategy`
   - `branch_phone_numbers`
   - `voice_keywords`
   - Global SMS/WhatsApp settings

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Implemented Full Phone Configuration Fields
```php
// Copied the complete implementation from QuickSetupWizard
protected function getEnhancedPhoneConfigurationFields(): array
{
    // Now includes:
    // - Phone strategy selection (direct/hotline/mixed)
    // - Hotline configuration with routing strategies
    // - Voice menu keywords
    // - Branch phone numbers repeater
    // - SMS/WhatsApp settings
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Data Loading
```php
protected function loadPhoneConfiguration(): void
{
    // Now loads:
    // - Phone strategy determination
    // - Voice keywords from routing config
    // - Branch phone numbers with all settings
    // - Global SMS/WhatsApp settings
}
```

### 3. Fixed Database Field References
```php
// Changed from:
'duration_minutes' => $s->duration_minutes ?? $s->duration ?? 30,

// To:
'duration_minutes' => $s->duration ?? $s->default_duration_minutes ?? 30,
```

### 4. Fixed Form Submit Action
```php
// Changed from HTML string to proper Action:
->submitAction(
    Action::make('submit')
        ->label(fn() => $this->editMode ? 'Änderungen speichern' : 'Setup abschließen')
        ->submit('completeSetup')
)
```

### 5. Added Proper Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks around data loading
- Added logging for debugging
- Added form refresh dispatch for Livewire

## Data Verification

Running `php test-wizard-data-simple.php 1` shows:
- Company has Cal.com integration ✅
- Company has Retell.ai integration ✅
- 2 branches configured ✅
- 6 active services ✅
- 2 phone numbers ✅

## Testing Instructions

1. Clear all caches:
   ```bash
   php artisan optimize:clear
   php artisan filament:clear-cached-components
   ```

2. Test the wizard:
   ```
   https://api.askproai.de/admin/quick-setup-wizard-v2?company=1
   ```

3. Verify:
   - All company data is loaded (name, industry, logo)
   - Branch information is populated
   - Phone configuration shows existing setup
   - Services are listed in the repeater
   - Staff members are shown
   - API keys show as [ENCRYPTED]

## Additional Notes

- The company ID 1 is "AskProAI Test Company" (not "askproai")
- The wizard now properly handles tenant scope issues
- Form data is logged for debugging (check Laravel logs)
- All caches must be cleared after code changes for Livewire components

## Files Modified

1. `/app/Filament/Admin/Pages/QuickSetupWizardV2.php`
   - Fixed data loading methods
   - Implemented complete phone configuration
   - Added error handling and logging
   - Fixed form submission

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check Laravel logs: `tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log`
3. Run the debug script: `php test-wizard-debug.html`
4. Verify Livewire component state in browser console
