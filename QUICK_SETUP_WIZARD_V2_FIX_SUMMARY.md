# Quick Setup Wizard V2 - Retell Configuration Fix

## Issue #200 Summary

The Quick Setup Wizard V2 was asking for Retell.ai configuration details that should be configured directly in Retell.ai, not in our system.

## What Was Fixed

### Removed Redundant Fields:
- ❌ `retell_voice_model` - Voice selection dropdown
- ❌ `retell_greeting` - Greeting text area

These fields were being collected but never saved or used anywhere in the system.

### What Remains:
- ✅ `retell_api_key` - Essential for API authentication
- ✅ `retell_agent_id` - Essential to identify which agent to use

## New Workflow

### 1. Configuration in Retell.ai
Users must configure their agent directly in Retell.ai:
- Voice selection
- Greeting message
- Prompt instructions
- Response behavior
- Custom functions

### 2. Integration in AskProAI
Users only need to provide:
- API Key from Retell.ai
- Agent ID of their configured agent

### UI Improvements

1. **Clear Instructions**: Added a prominent blue info box explaining that configuration happens in Retell.ai
2. **Step-by-Step Guide**: Numbered list showing exactly what to do
3. **Helpful Links**: 
   - Direct link to Retell.ai dashboard
   - Link to Retell.ai documentation
   - Link to AskProAI configuration guide
   - Template download link
4. **"Open Retell.ai Dashboard" Button**: Quick access to the external configuration

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
The system stores:
- `companies.retell_api_key` - Encrypted API key
- `companies.retell_agent_id` - Agent identifier
- `companies.retell_default_settings` - JSON field for future use (currently unused)

### Agent Configuration
- Agents are configured entirely in Retell.ai
- AskProAI only references agents by ID
- No agent configuration is stored locally

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: Users configure in one place (Retell.ai)
2. **Flexibility**: Full access to all Retell.ai features
3. **Maintenance**: No need to sync configuration between systems
4. **Clarity**: Clear separation of concerns

## Migration Notes

For existing installations:
- The removed fields were never saved, so no data migration needed
- Users who filled out these fields before will need to configure in Retell.ai
- The wizard now clearly explains the correct workflow
