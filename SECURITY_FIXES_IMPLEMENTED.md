# Security Fixes Implementation Report

**Date**: 2025-06-19
**Implemented by**: Claude Code

## Overview
This document outlines the critical security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the AskProAI codebase.

## 1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities ✅

### Issues Fixed:
- Replaced unsafe `whereRaw()` queries with parameterized queries in `FindDuplicates.php`
- Fixed unsafe query in `TenantScope.php` that used `whereRaw('1 = 0')`
- Created `SecureQueryBuilder` trait with safe query methods

### Files Modified:
- `/app/Filament/Admin/Resources/CustomerResource/Pages/FindDuplicates.php`
- `/app/Scopes/TenantScope.php`
- `/app/Traits/SecureQueryBuilder.php` (new)

### Implementation:
- All raw SQL queries now use parameter binding
- Created reusable secure query methods for common patterns
- Added phone number normalization in queries

## 2. Input Validation ✅

### Components Created:
1. **InputValidationMiddleware** - Validates all incoming requests
2. **InputValidator** - Core validation logic with patterns for:
   - SQL injection detection
   - XSS attack detection
   - Path traversal detection
   - Phone number validation
   - Date/time validation

3. **Custom Validation Rules**:
   - `PhoneNumber` - Validates phone numbers with injection protection
   - `SafeString` - Ensures strings are safe from malicious content

4. **Request Classes**:
   - `StoreAppointmentRequest` - Validates appointment creation with proper sanitization

### Files Created:
- `/app/Http/Middleware/InputValidationMiddleware.php`
- `/app/Security/InputValidator.php`
- `/app/Rules/PhoneNumber.php`
- `/app/Rules/SafeString.php`
- `/app/Http/Requests/Api/StoreAppointmentRequest.php`

## 3. Security Middleware Implementation ✅

### Middleware Stack:
1. **ThreatDetectionMiddleware** - Already existed, now active globally
2. **InputValidationMiddleware** - Applied to all API routes
3. **AdaptiveRateLimitMiddleware** - Intelligent rate limiting
4. **WebhookReplayProtection** - Prevents webhook replay attacks

### Routes Protected:
- All API routes now have input validation
- Webhook endpoints have replay protection
- Hybrid booking routes have additional validation

### Files Modified:
- `/app/Http/Kernel.php` - Registered all security middleware
- `/routes/api.php` - Applied middleware to routes

## 4. XSS Vulnerability Fixes ✅

### Issues Fixed:
- Fixed unescaped output in `/resources/views/filament/resources/call-resource/action-items.blade.php`
- Changed `{!! $recommendedAction !!}` to `{{ $recommendedAction }}`

### Note:
- Other uses of `{!! !!}` were safe as they used `json_encode()` for JavaScript context
- All Blade templates now properly escape output

## 5. Webhook Replay Protection ✅

### Implementation:
- Created `WebhookReplayProtection` middleware with:
  - 5-minute replay attack window detection
  - 1-hour deduplication window
  - Idempotent response caching
  - Redis/Cache fallback support

### Features:
- Automatic webhook ID extraction from multiple sources
- Payload hash generation for webhooks without IDs
- Atomic operations using Redis SETNX
- Response caching for idempotency

### Protected Endpoints:
- `/calcom/webhook`
- `/retell/webhook`
- `/stripe/webhook`

### Files Created:
- `/app/Http/Middleware/WebhookReplayProtection.php`

## 6. Database Security Enhancements ✅

### New Tables:
1. **security_audit_logs** - Tracks all security events
2. **webhook_deduplication** - Prevents duplicate webhook processing
3. **rate_limit_violations** - Tracks rate limit violations

### Enhanced Tables:
- **customers**: Added security flags and verification tracking
- **users**: Added login tracking, 2FA fields, and account locking
- **companies**: Added security settings and IP allowlisting
- **api_call_logs**: Added threat scoring and blocking

### Migration:
- `/database/migrations/2025_06_19_182915_add_security_fields_to_tables.php`

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security (validation, sanitization, rate limiting)
- Fail-safe defaults (block suspicious requests)
- Comprehensive logging for security events

### 2. Input Validation
- All user inputs validated and sanitized
- Custom validation rules for specific data types
- Pattern matching for common attack vectors

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Adaptive limits based on user type and history
- Separate limits for different endpoint types
- Automatic throttling for repeat offenders

### 4. Webhook Security
- Signature verification (already existed)
- Replay attack protection (new)
- Idempotent processing with response caching

### 5. Audit Trail
- All security events logged to database
- Correlation IDs for request tracking
- Threat indicators stored for analysis

## Recommendations for Further Hardening

1. **Enable 2FA for all admin users**
2. **Implement IP allowlisting for admin panel**
3. **Regular security audits using automated tools**
4. **Implement Content Security Policy headers**
5. **Add HSTS headers for HTTPS enforcement**
6. **Regular dependency updates**
7. **Implement database query logging for sensitive operations**
8. **Add honeypot fields to public forms**

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Run penetration testing** on all public endpoints
2. **Test rate limiting** with load testing tools
3. **Verify webhook deduplication** with duplicate requests
4. **Test input validation** with OWASP test strings
5. **Monitor security logs** for false positives

## Deployment Checklist

- [x] Run migrations: `php artisan migrate --force`
- [ ] Clear all caches: `php artisan optimize:clear`
- [ ] Update environment variables if needed
- [ ] Monitor error logs after deployment
- [ ] Test webhook endpoints with valid signatures
- [ ] Verify rate limiting is not too restrictive
- [ ] Check that legitimate traffic is not blocked

## Summary

All critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed:
- ✅ SQL injection vulnerabilities fixed
- ✅ Input validation implemented
- ✅ Security middleware active
- ✅ XSS vulnerabilities patched
- ✅ Webhook replay protection added
- ✅ Database security enhanced

The application now has comprehensive security measures in place to protect against common attack vectors.
