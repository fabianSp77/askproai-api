# Retell Agent Export/Import Feature - Implementation Complete

## Overview
The agent configuration export/import feature has been successfully implemented in the Retell Ultimate Control Center. This feature allows users to export agent configurations as JSON files and re-import them, facilitating backup, sharing, and modification of agent configurations.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend Implementation (RetellUltimateControlCenter.php)

#### Export Functionality
```php
public function exportAgent(string $agentId): void
{
    // Get agent from API
    // Sanitize sensitive data
    // Add metadata (export date, user, version)
    // Trigger JSON download via Livewire event
}
```

Key features:
- Removes sensitive data (agent_id, timestamps, secrets)
- Adds export metadata for tracking
- Generates timestamped filename
- Dispatches download event to frontend

#### Import Functionality
```php
public function updatedAgentImportFile(): void
{
    // Validate uploaded JSON file
    // Parse and validate structure
    // Create new agent via Retell API
    // Handle errors gracefully
}
```

Key features:
- File validation (JSON format, max 2MB)
- Structure validation for required fields
- Voice ID validation against known voices
- Error handling with user feedback

### 2. Frontend Implementation

#### UI Components Added:
1. **Import Button** - Located in the agents tab header
   - File upload input (hidden)
   - Accepts .json files only
   - Uses Livewire file upload

2. **Export Button** - Added to each agent card
   - Yellow color scheme for visibility
   - Located in quick actions section
   - Triggers JSON download

#### JavaScript Implementation:
```javascript
// Handle agent export
Livewire.on('download-json', (data) => {
    // Create blob from JSON content
    // Trigger browser download
    // Show success notification
});
```

### 3. Export Format

The exported JSON includes:
```json
{
  "agent_name": "Agent Name",
  "voice_id": "openai-Alloy",
  "response_engine": {
    "type": "retell_llm",
    "llm_id": "...",
    "_note": "LLM ID will need to be updated after import"
  },
  "language": "de",
  "webhook_settings": {
    "url": "...",
    // secret removed for security
  },
  "_export_metadata": {
    "exported_at": "2025-06-26T10:00:00Z",
    "exported_by": "user@example.com",
    "askproai_version": "1.0",
    "original_agent_id": "agent_xxx",
    "original_agent_name": "Original Name"
  }
}
```

### 4. Security Considerations

- Sensitive data removed on export:
  - Agent IDs (not transferable)
  - Timestamps
  - Webhook secrets
  - API keys

- Import validation:
  - File size limit (2MB)
  - JSON format validation
  - Required fields check
  - Voice ID validation

### 5. User Workflow

1. **Export Agent**:
   - Navigate to Retell Ultimate Control Center
   - Click "Export" button on any agent card
   - JSON file downloads automatically
   - Success notification appears

2. **Import Agent**:
   - Click "Import Agent" button in agents tab
   - Select modified JSON file
   - Agent is created with new ID
   - Page refreshes to show new agent

### 6. Compatibility with Retell.ai

The export format is compatible with Retell.ai's agent structure, allowing:
- Manual upload to retellai.com dashboard
- Modification of agent settings
- Re-import to AskProAI system

### 7. Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Bulk export/import for multiple agents
- Export presets/templates
- Version control integration
- Diff viewer for comparing agents
- Automated backup scheduling
