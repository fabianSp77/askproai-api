    -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "customer_id": 1,
      "call_id": 1,
      "service_id": 1,
      "scheduled_at": "2025-10-15 14:00:00",
      "duration_minutes": 60
    }'

  # Expected: 201 Created with complete metadata
  ```

- [ ] **Portal Lookup**
  ```bash
  curl https://portal.example.com/api/appointments/lookup?email=test@example.com

  # Expected: 200 OK with consistent customer name
  ```

- [ ] **Monitoring Endpoints**
  ```bash
  curl https://api.example.com/api/monitoring/p95

  # Expected: 200 OK with P95 metrics
  ```

### 9. Live Data Validation üîç

- [ ] **Sample Production Data Check**
  ```sql
  -- Check first 10 recent appointments for metadata completeness
  SELECT
      id,
      customer_id,
      created_by,
      booking_source,
      rescheduled_at,
      rescheduled_by
  FROM appointments
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

- [ ] **Modification Records Check**
  ```sql
  -- Verify recent modifications have complete metadata
  SELECT
      id,
      appointment_id,
      modification_type,
      modified_by,
      metadata
  FROM appointment_modifications
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

### 10. User Acceptance Testing üë•

  - [ ] Customer can lookup appointment by email
  - [ ] Customer name displays correctly
  - [ ] Booking details show complete metadata
  - [ ] Reschedule flow works end-to-end
  - [ ] Cancellation flow works end-to-end
  - [ ] Modification history displays correctly

- [ ] **Admin Panel Testing**
  - [ ] Admin can view appointment details

## Rollback Criteria ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Trigger rollback if**:

1. **Critical Data Integrity Issues**
   - More than 5% of appointments missing metadata
   - Name inconsistencies detected in production data
   - Orphaned records found in production

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - P95 latency exceeds 1000ms for any endpoint
   - Database query performance issues detected
   - User-facing timeout errors

3. **Functional Failures**
   - Booking flow fails for any user
   - Reschedule/cancellation flows broken
   - Portal lookup returns incorrect data

4. **Security Issues**
   - Tenant isolation breach detected
   - Unauthorized data access logged
   - Authentication/authorization bypass discovered

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Continuous Validation (First 24 Hours)

- [ ] **Hour 1**: Run full SQL validation suite every 15 minutes
- [ ] **Hour 2-4**: Run SQL validation every 30 minutes
- [ ] **Hour 4-24**: Run SQL validation every 2 hours

**Monitoring Dashboard**: `/api/monitoring/p95`

### Automated Alerts

- [ ] Configure alert for metadata completeness < 95%
- [ ] Configure alert for name consistency issues detected
- [ ] Configure alert for P95 latency > 500ms
- [ ] Configure alert for orphaned records detected

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Unit tests fail with "Class not found"
**Solution**: Run `composer dump-autoload`

**Issue**: Browser tests fail with "Connection refused"
**Solution**: Ensure Laravel dev server running on port 8000

**Issue**: SQL validation shows metadata issues
**Solution**: Run migration to add missing columns:
```bash
php artisan migrate --path=database/migrations/[migration_file].php
```

**Issue**: Performance tests fail P95 targets
**Solution**: Check database indexes:
```sql
SHOW INDEX FROM appointments;
SHOW INDEX FROM appointment_modifications;
```
