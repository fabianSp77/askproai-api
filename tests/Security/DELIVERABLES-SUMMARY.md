## Integration Points

### Continuous Integration (CI/CD)

**GitHub Actions Example**:
```yaml
- name: Run Security Tests
  run: |
    cd tests/Security
    ./run-all-security-tests.sh
```

**GitLab CI Example**:
```yaml
security-tests:
  script:
    - cd tests/Security
    - ./run-all-security-tests.sh
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - tests/Security/reports/
```

**Jenkins Pipeline**:
```groovy
stage('Security Tests') {
    steps {
        sh 'cd tests/Security && ./run-all-security-tests.sh'
    }
    post {
        always {
            publishHTML([
                reportDir: 'tests/Security/reports/latest',
                reportFiles: 'security_test_report.html',
                reportName: 'Security Test Report'
            ])
        }
    }
}
```

## Remediation Workflow

If tests FAIL, follow this workflow:

1. **Review Report**
   ```bash
   # Check which tests failed
   grep "✗ FAIL" reports/*/security_test_report.txt
   ```

2. **Consult Documentation**
   - Open PHASE-B-SECURITY-TEST-DOCUMENTATION.md
   - Navigate to failed attack scenario
   - Review "Remediation Guidance" section

3. **Apply Fix**
   - Implement recommended security control
   - Add missing middleware
   - Fix authorization policy
   - Add input validation

4. **Re-test**
   ```bash
   ./run-all-security-tests.sh
   ```

5. **Verify**
   - Ensure test now passes
   - Check no new failures introduced
   - Review warnings for potential issues

2. Execute test suite on staging environment
3. Verify all tests pass (or document known issues)
4. Add to CI/CD pipeline

### Ongoing Maintenance
1. Run tests before each production deployment
2. Update tests when new features are added
3. Re-test after security patches
4. Review and update CVSS scores annually

### Future Enhancements
