# Retell Ultimate Control Center - Livewire Serialization Fix

## Problem
The dashboard was showing no content with the following symptoms:
- Dashboard Inhalte nicht angezeigt (Dashboard content not displayed)
- Agents nicht vorhanden (Agents not visible)
- Phone number dropdown leer (Phone number dropdown empty)

## Root Cause
Livewire cannot serialize service instances between requests. The code was trying to store `RetellV2Service` and `CalcomV2Service` instances as class properties, which caused a `PropertyNotFoundException` when Livewire tried to serialize the component state.

## Solution
Refactored the service handling to follow Livewire best practices:

1. **Removed service instances as properties**
   - Removed `protected ?RetellV2Service $retellService = null`
   - Removed `protected ?CalcomV2Service $calcomService = null`

2. **Added serializable data storage**
   ```php
   protected ?string $retellApiKey = null;
   protected ?int $companyId = null;
   ```

3. **Created getter methods for on-demand service instantiation**
   ```php
   protected function getRetellService(): ?RetellV2Service
   {
       if (!$this->retellApiKey) {
           return null;
       }
       return new RetellV2Service($this->retellApiKey);
   }
   ```

4. **Updated all method calls**
   - Replaced all `$this->retellService` with `$this->getRetellService()`
   - Total of 16 occurrences fixed throughout the file

## Result
- ✅ Dashboard loads successfully
- ✅ 11 agents displayed (grouped by base name)
- ✅ 8 phone numbers loaded
- ✅ All dropdowns populated correctly
- ✅ No more Livewire serialization errors

## Technical Details
The fix ensures that only primitive/serializable data is stored in Livewire component properties, while service instances are created on-demand when needed. This follows Livewire's architecture requirements and prevents serialization issues.

## Test Results
```
Fixed service handling: SUCCESS
Data loading: SUCCESS
Agents loaded: 11
Phone numbers loaded: 8
