EXECUTIVE BRIEF - V4 Agent Test Call RCA
Call ID: call_4fe3efe8beada329a8270b3e8a2
Date: 2025-10-25 13:12-13:15 UTC+2

=== CRITICAL FINDINGS ===

BUG #1: HARDCODED call_id="1"
- Both check_availability_v17 and book_appointment_v17 receive call_id="1" instead of actual call ID
- This breaks call tracking and prevents correlation of bookings to this specific call
- Location: app/Http/Controllers/RetellFunctionCallHandler.php
- Severity: BLOCKER

BUG #2: AVAILABILITY DATE MISMATCH
- User requested: 25.10.2025 at 15:00 (today)
- Function received: datum="25.10.2025", uhrzeit="15:00" (correct)
- System returned: Alternatives for 2025-10-27 (WRONG DATE - 2 days later!)
- Root cause: Check_availability function querying wrong date or date parsing broken
- Location: app/Services/Retell/AppointmentCreationService.php
- Severity: BLOCKER

BUG #3: SILENT BOOKING FAILURE
- User accepted alternative (08:00 on 27th)
- NO email confirmation logged
- NO appointment confirmation message to user
- Booking may have been recorded under call_id=1 (wrong call)
- Location: app/Http/Controllers/Api/RetellApiController.php
- Severity: BLOCKER

=== UX ISSUES ===

- Agent asks for name twice (data collection redundancy)
- Agent doesn't understand "heute" (today) - needs explicit date format
- Flow structure causes conversation to restart data collection
- Call duration: 3min 36sec (should be <2min for this simple booking)

=== IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED ===

1. ROLLBACK V4 agent immediately - do not use in production
2. Fix hardcoded call_id="1" in RetellFunctionCallHandler
3. Debug date parameter handling in availability check
4. Verify booking confirmation logic
5. Re-test all flows before re-deployment

=== EVIDENCE ===

From Log Line 11:
{
  "name": "check_availability_v17",
  "args": {
    "call_id": "1",    ← HARDCODED - Should be: call_4fe3efe8beada329a8270b3e8a2
    "datum": "25.10.2025",
    "uhrzeit": "15:00"
  }
}

From Log Line 19:
{
  "count": 2,
  "times": ["2025-10-27 08:00", "2025-10-27 06:00"]  ← WRONG DATE! Should be 25.10
}

See: TESTCALL_RCA_COMPLETE_V4_2025-10-25.md (Full analysis with code locations and testing approach)

=== IMPACT ASSESSMENT ===

Customer Impact:
- Wrong date offered (would book appointment 2 days later)
- No confirmation email (booking may have failed silently)
- Frustrating experience with repeated questions

System Impact:
- Broken call tracking (can't link bookings to calls)
- Silent booking failures (no audit trail)
- Data corruption (bookings stored under call_id=1)

Production Readiness:
- V4 agent is NOT READY for production
- Must fix critical bugs before release
- All booking flows need re-testing

Estimated Fix Time:
- Critical bugs: 4-6 hours
- UX improvements: 2-4 hours
- Testing & QA: 2-3 hours
- Total: ~8-13 hours

=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===

SHORT TERM (Today):
1. Rollback V4 agent
2. Fix hardcoded call_id in RetellFunctionCallHandler
3. Add unit tests for parameter injection
4. Add date parameter validation

MEDIUM TERM (This Week):
1. Fix date parsing in AppointmentCreationService
2. Consolidate data collection logic
3. Add natural language date parsing
4. Full E2E testing of booking flow

LONG TERM (Next Sprint):
1. Redesign conversation flow for better UX
2. Add conversation state preservation
3. Implement automatic retry logic for failed bookings
4. Add comprehensive monitoring/alerting
