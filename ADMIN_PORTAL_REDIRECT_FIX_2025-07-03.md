# Admin Portal Redirect Fix - TenantScope Priority Issue

## Date: 2025-07-03

## Issue (GitHub #263, #264)
When clicking on "Astro AI" (Company ID 15) in the Business Portal Admin, the user was redirected to "KrÃ¼ckeberg" (Company ID 1) instead. This was happening because the TenantScope was using the admin user's company_id instead of the target company_id from the session.

## Root Cause
The TenantScope's `getCurrentCompanyId()` method was checking for authenticated user's company_id before checking the admin_impersonation session data. Since the admin user belongs to company_id 1, all queries were being filtered to show only data for company 1.

## Solution
Modified the TenantScope to prioritize admin impersonation session data over the authenticated user's company_id.

### Code Changes

#### /app/Scopes/TenantScope.php
Added admin impersonation check as the FIRST priority in `getCurrentCompanyId()`:

```php
private function getCurrentCompanyId(): ?string
{
    // 0. PRIORITY: Check for admin impersonation FIRST
    if (session()->has('admin_impersonation')) {
        $adminImpersonation = session('admin_impersonation');
        if (isset($adminImpersonation['company_id'])) {
            return $adminImpersonation['company_id'];
        }
    }
    
    // ... rest of the checks follow ...
}
```

## Flow Explanation
1. Admin clicks on "Astro AI" in Business Portal Admin
2. BusinessPortalAdmin generates a token with company_id = 15
3. Browser redirects to `/business/admin-access?token=...`
4. AdminAccessController validates token and sets session:
   - `admin_impersonation['company_id'] = 15`
   - `is_admin_viewing = true`
5. DashboardController loads company data
6. TenantScope now checks admin_impersonation FIRST and finds company_id = 15
7. All queries are now filtered by company_id = 15 (Astro AI)

## Testing
```bash
# Test script created: test-admin-impersonation.php
php test-admin-impersonation.php

# Output shows:
# TenantScope detected company ID: 15
```

## Result
Admins can now correctly view any company's portal without being redirected to their own company's data. The TenantScope respects the admin impersonation context throughout the session.

## Security Considerations
- Admin impersonation requires Super Admin role
- Session data is properly validated
- Original admin session is preserved
- Admin can exit impersonation mode to return to admin panel
