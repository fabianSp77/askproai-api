## Root Cause Validation

### Problem #1: Slot Availability Bug
**Hypothesis**: `isTimeAvailable()` method rejects valid slots due to time comparison error
**Evidence**:
- [x] Cal.com returns 32 slots (verified in logs)
- [x] System searches for 13:00, 14:00, 11:30
- [x] All marked "not available" in response
- [x] Same slots later offered as alternatives
- [x] Indicates slots ARE in array but failing comparison

**Likelihood**: 95% - Direct evidence from transcript

### Problem #2: call_id = "None"
**Hypothesis**: Retell agent prompt not injecting {{CALL_ID}} variable
**Evidence**:
- [x] Function call shows `"call_id": "None"` (literal string)
- [x] Fallback attempted but failed
- [x] Backend error: "Call context not available"
- [x] Call context lookup requires valid call_id
- [x] No other explanation for literal "None" string

**Likelihood**: 100% - Exact error message matches
