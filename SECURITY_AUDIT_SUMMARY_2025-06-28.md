# Security Audit Summary - Test Endpoints Removal
Date: 2025-06-28

## Actions Taken

### 1. Removed Test Endpoints from API Routes
- Commented out `/api/retell/collect-appointment/test` endpoint
- Removed `/api/retell/debug-webhook` debug endpoint
- Removed `/api/test/webhook` test endpoint
- Removed `/api/test/calcom-v2/*` test routes
- Removed `/api/mobile/test` endpoint
- Removed `/api/mcp/calcom/test/{companyId}` endpoints
- Removed `/api/mcp/retell/test/{companyId}` endpoints
- Removed generic `/api/webhook` endpoint (no signature verification)

### 2. Removed Test Files
- Deleted `routes/test-webhook.php`
- Deleted test route files: `livewire-test.php`, `test-*.php`, `session-test.php`
- Removed test files from public directory: `test-*.php`, `ui-test-report.html`
- Deleted `TestWebhookController.php` and `Api/TestWebhookController.php`
- Removed test method from `RetellAppointmentCollectorController.php`

### 3. Secured Development Scripts
- Moved 53 test/development PHP scripts from root to `storage/test-scripts-backup/`
- These scripts are now outside the web root and cannot be accessed via HTTP

### 4. Added Missing Security Middleware
- Added signature verification to `/api/retell/mcp-webhook`: `verify.retell.signature`
- Added authentication to `/api/retell/mcp-webhook/health`: `auth:sanctum`
- All webhook endpoints now require proper signature verification

## Remaining Secure Endpoints

### Webhook Endpoints (All Protected)
- `/api/retell/webhook` - Protected by `verify.retell.signature`
- `/api/calcom/webhook` - Protected by `calcom.signature`
- `/api/stripe/webhook` - Protected by `verify.stripe.signature`
- `/api/billing/webhook` - Protected by `verify.stripe.signature`
- `/api/mcp/retell/webhook` - Protected by `verify.retell.signature`

### Health Check Endpoints (Public but Safe)
- `/api/health` - Simple health check for load balancers
- `/api/health/comprehensive` - Detailed health check
- `/api/health/service/{service}` - Service-specific health checks

### Protected MCP Endpoints
All MCP endpoints under `/api/mcp/*` require:
- `auth:sanctum` - Authentication required
- `throttle:100,1` - Rate limiting
- `validate.company.context` - Company context validation

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check for remaining test routes
grep -E "Route::(get|post|put|delete|patch).*test" /var/www/api-gateway/routes/api.php | grep -v "//"

# Check for test files in public
find /var/www/api-gateway/public -name "*test*" -type f

# Verify webhook middleware
grep -n "webhook" /var/www/api-gateway/routes/api.php | grep -E "Route::"
```

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Security Audits**: Schedule monthly reviews of routes and endpoints
2. **Environment-based Routes**: Use environment checks for any future test endpoints
3. **Signature Verification**: Never create webhook endpoints without signature verification
4. **Documentation**: Update API documentation to reflect removed endpoints
5. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for any unauthorized endpoint access attempts

## Impact
- No legitimate functionality affected
- All production webhooks remain functional with proper security
- Development/test endpoints no longer accessible in production
- Reduced attack surface significantly
