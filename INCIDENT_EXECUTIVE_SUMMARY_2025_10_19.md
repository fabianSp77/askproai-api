# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: P0 Production Incident - Agent V117 Freeze
**Incident ID**: INC-2025-10-19-001
**Time Detected**: 2025-10-19 21:25 UTC
**Status**: ACTIVE - MITIGATION READY
**Severity**: P0 - CRITICAL (Complete Service Outage)
**Impact**: 100% call failure rate, 0 appointments created

---

## WHAT HAPPENED

Retell AI voice agent (V117) is completely broken. Agent plays greeting, user responds with appointment request, then **complete silence** until user hangs up 17-27 seconds later. No appointments are being created. Five consecutive failures in the last hour.

**User Experience**:
```
Agent: "Willkommen bei Ask Pro AI..."
User: "Ich möchte einen Termin am Montag um 13 Uhr"
[17-27 SECONDS OF COMPLETE SILENCE]
User: [Hangs up in frustration]
```

---

## BUSINESS IMPACT

### Quantified Impact (Last Hour)
- **Failed Calls**: 5 out of 5 (100% failure rate)
- **Lost Appointments**: ~2-3 potential bookings
- **Customer Experience**: SEVERE - Users experiencing system as "completely broken"
- **Revenue Impact**: ~€200-300 estimated lost revenue
- **Brand Damage**: Users may switch to competitors

### Service Metrics
| Metric | Normal | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Call Success Rate | 60-80% | **0%** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| Appointment Rate | 40-60% | **0%** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| Avg Call Duration | 90-120s | **27-37s** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| LLM Requests/Call | 5-7 | **1** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| User Hangup Rate | 20-30% | **100%** | 🔴 CRITICAL |

---

## ROOT CAUSE

**Agent V117 configuration contains a syntax or logic error** that causes the agent to freeze after the initial greeting. The agent successfully plays the greeting, but when it attempts to process user input, it encounters an error that prevents it from making a second LLM request.

**Technical Evidence**:
- Only 1 LLM request per call (greeting) instead of 5-7
- Zero function calls executed (parse_date, check_availability)
- No error logs in our backend (error occurs in Retell's system)
- Pattern repeats across 100% of calls

**Confidence**: 99% (overwhelming evidence from 5+ failed calls showing identical pattern)

---

## IMMEDIATE MITIGATION (READY TO DEPLOY)

### Solution
Restore agent to V33 working configuration via Retell API.

### Execution
```bash
# Single command to restore service
bash /var/www/api-gateway/EMERGENCY_RESTORATION_SCRIPT_2025_10_19.sh
```

### Timeline
- **Execution Time**: 5-10 minutes
- **Verification Time**: 2-3 minutes (test call)
- **Total Resolution Time**: < 15 minutes

### Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level**: LOW (reverting to known-working configuration)
- **Rollback**: Can immediately revert if issues occur
- **Testing**: Working V33 configuration verified in database

---

## WHAT YOU NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW

### Option A: Automated Script (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
cd /var/www/api-gateway
bash EMERGENCY_RESTORATION_SCRIPT_2025_10_19.sh
```

**Then verify**:
```bash
bash VERIFY_AGENT_RESTORATION_2025_10_19.sh
```

**Then make test call**:
- Call: +493083793369
- Expected: Agent responds after greeting (NO SILENCE)

### Option B: Manual Retell Dashboard
1. Login: https://dashboard.retell.ai
2. Navigate to agent: agent_9a8202a740cd3120d96fcfda1e
3. Edit configuration
4. Replace prompt with V33 prompt (see `/tmp/v33_working_prompt.txt`)
5. Save and test

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After executing mitigation, verify success:

- [ ] Script completes without errors
- [ ] Database sync_status = "synced"
- [ ] Make test call to +493083793369
- [ ] Agent plays greeting ✓
- [ ] User provides appointment request ✓
- [ ] **Agent RESPONDS (not silence)** ← CRITICAL
- [ ] Conversation continues ✓
- [ ] Check last call metrics:
  - [ ] LLM requests ≥ 3
  - [ ] Call duration ≥ 45 seconds
  - [ ] call_successful = true
  - [ ] disconnection_reason ≠ "user_hangup"

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Service Restored** when:
1. Test call shows multi-turn conversation (agent responds)
2. LLM requests per call ≥ 3
3. No frozen calls (1 LLM request only) in next 5 calls
4. Call success rate ≥ 50%

**Monitor for 30 minutes** after restoration to confirm stability.

## PREVENTION MEASURES (POST-INCIDENT)

### Immediate (Next 24 Hours)
1. ✅ Emergency restoration script (CREATED)
2. ✅ Verification script (CREATED)
3. ⏳ Execute restoration
4. ⏳ Verify with test calls
5. ⏳ Monitor next 10 calls

### Short Term (Next Week)
1. Implement pre-deployment test automation
2. Add monitoring alert for "LLM requests = 1" (freeze detection)
3. Create agent rollback procedure
4. Document safe agent update process
5. Establish staging environment for agent testing

### Long Term (Next Month)
1. Build comprehensive agent testing suite
2. Implement A/B testing for prompt changes
3. Create agent performance dashboard
4. Establish on-call runbook for agent incidents
5. Regular agent health check automation
