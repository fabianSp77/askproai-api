### Security
- Bearer token authentication with primary/backup tokens
- Request signature validation
- Rate limiting (100 req/min for tools, 300 for health)
- IP-based throttling
- Request size limits (10MB)

### Reliability
- Circuit breaker with configurable thresholds
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Health checks every 30 seconds
- Comprehensive error handling

### Observability
- Prometheus metrics for all endpoints
- Grafana dashboards with business metrics
- AlertManager integration
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Performance trend tracking

## Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Preparation
1. Copy `.env.mcp.example` to configure environment
2. Generate secure authentication tokens
3. Run `validate-mcp-deployment.sh` to verify setup
4. Execute pre-deployment tests

### Phase 2: Deployment
1. Run `deploy-mcp-migration.sh` with 0% rollout
2. Verify MCP endpoint functionality
3. Set up monitoring stack
4. Import Grafana dashboards

### Phase 3: Migration
1. Gradual rollout: 10% → 25% → 50% → 75% → 100%
2. Monitor performance at each step
3. Health checks between rollout phases
4. Automatic rollback if issues detected

### Phase 4: Monitoring
1. 24/7 monitoring with alerts
2. Performance comparison dashboards
3. Business metric tracking
4. Regular health check reports

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Warning | Critical |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| Response Time (p95) | <500ms | >300ms | >1000ms |
| Error Rate | <1% | >5% | >10% |
| Tool Success Rate | >98% | <95% | <90% |
| Concurrent Requests | <30 | >30 | >50 |

## Alert Configuration

### Response Time Alerts
- Warning: 95th percentile >500ms for 2 minutes
- Critical: 95th percentile >1000ms for 1 minute

### Error Rate Alerts
- Warning: Error rate >5% for 2 minutes
- Critical: Error rate >10% for 1 minute

### Circuit Breaker Alerts
- Critical: Circuit breaker open (immediate)
- Warning: Circuit breaker half-open for >1 minute

### Business Impact Alerts
- Critical: Booking failure rate >2% for 5 minutes
- Warning: Cal.com integration down for 2 minutes

## Emergency Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Response time >2000ms for 5 minutes
- Error rate >25% for 2 minutes
- Circuit breaker open for >5 minutes
- Database connectivity lost

### Manual Rollback
```bash
# Emergency rollback (immediate)
./scripts/rollback-mcp.sh --emergency

# Standard rollback (with confirmation)
./scripts/rollback-mcp.sh
```

### Health Check Commands
```bash
# Quick validation
./scripts/validate-mcp-deployment.sh --quick

# Comprehensive health check
./scripts/mcp-health-check.sh --comprehensive

# Continuous monitoring
watch -n 30 './scripts/mcp-health-check.sh'
```

## Monitoring Endpoints

- **MCP Health**: `GET /api/mcp/retell/health`
- **MCP Tools**: `POST /api/mcp/retell/tools`
- **Prometheus Metrics**: `GET /api/metrics`
- **Grafana Dashboard**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **AlertManager**: `http://localhost:9093`

## Next Steps

1. **Review Configuration**: Examine `.env.mcp.example` and customize for your environment
2. **Generate Tokens**: Create secure authentication tokens
3. **Run Validation**: Execute `validate-mcp-deployment.sh` to verify setup
4. **Deploy Monitoring**: Set up Prometheus and Grafana stack
5. **Execute Deployment**: Run `deploy-mcp-migration.sh` with 0% rollout
6. **Gradual Rollout**: Increase rollout percentage based on performance
7. **Monitor and Optimize**: Use dashboards to track performance and optimize

## Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check logs in `/var/log/mcp-migration-*.log`
2. Run health checks: `./scripts/mcp-health-check.sh`
3. Review Grafana dashboards for performance insights
4. Use rollback script if critical issues occur

The deployment system is designed to be robust, with comprehensive monitoring and automatic failsafes to ensure business continuity during the migration to MCP integration.
