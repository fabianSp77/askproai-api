# Route Not Defined Error Fix

## Issue
Error: `Route [business.analytics.index] not defined` when accessing `/business/settings`

## Root Cause
The analytics index route was missing because it was marked as "handled by React SPA catch-all route" but the layout file was still trying to generate a direct link to it.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Added Missing Route
Added the analytics index route in `/routes/business-portal.php`:

```php
Route::prefix('analytics')->name('analytics.')->group(function () {
    // Main analytics page (handled by React SPA)
    Route::get('/', function() {
        return view('portal.analytics.index-react');
    })->middleware('portal.permission:analytics.view')
        ->name('index');
    
    Route::get('/export', [AnalyticsController::class, 'export'])
        ->middleware('portal.permission:analytics.export')
        ->name('export');
});
```

### 2. Created View File
Created `/resources/views/portal/analytics/index-react.blade.php`:

```blade
@extends('portal.layouts.app')

@section('content')
<div id="analytics-index-root"></div>
@endsection

@push('scripts')
@vite(['resources/js/portal-analytics.jsx'])
@endpush
```

### 3. Cleared Caches
- Cleared route cache: `php artisan route:clear`
- Cleared config cache: `php artisan config:clear`

## Verification
All required routes now exist:
- ✅ `business.calls.index`
- ✅ `business.appointments.index`
- ✅ `business.billing.index`
- ✅ `business.analytics.index`
- ✅ `business.team.index`
- ✅ `business.settings.index`
- ✅ `business.admin.exit`

## Result
The settings page should now load without route errors. The navigation menu will properly generate all links.
