# Company Scope Fix Report - 2025-07-28 (Updated)

## Problem Summary
The admin panel pages (Calls, Appointments, Customers) were showing blank/not loading because the company context was not being set properly for authenticated users.

## Root Cause
The `EnsureCompanyContext` middleware was not being applied to the web routes, causing the `CompanyScope` global scope to not filter data by company_id. This resulted in:
1. Attempting to load all 877 records instead of just the 67 for the logged-in user's company
2. JavaScript errors and blank pages
3. Performance issues due to loading excessive data

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created ForceCompanyContext Middleware
- Location: `app/Http/Middleware/ForceCompanyContext.php`
- Purpose: Forces company context for all admin and livewire routes
- Sets `current_company_id` and `company_context_source` in the app container

### 2. Added Middleware to Web Group
- Modified `app/Http/Kernel.php`
- Added `\App\Http\Middleware\ForceCompanyContext::class` to the 'web' middleware group
- This ensures it runs for all web requests

### 3. Emergency Fix for Filament Resources
- Executed `public/emergency-fix-resources.php`
- Added mount() methods to:
  - `ListCalls.php`
  - `ListAppointments.php`
  - `ListCustomers.php`
  - `ListBranches.php`
- Each mount() method now explicitly sets company context as a fallback

### 4. Fixed CallResource Issues
- Removed `withoutGlobalScope(\App\Models\Scopes\CompanyScope::class)` calls
- Fixed customer field references from `first_name,last_name` to `name`
- Ensured proper eager loading with company scope active

## Verification
- Created test script `public/test-company-context.php`
- Confirmed company context is properly set
- Verified CompanyScope is filtering correctly (67 calls vs 877)
- All caches cleared
- PHP-FPM restarted

## Result
✅ Company context is now properly set for all admin requests
✅ Pages should load with the correct filtered data
✅ Performance should be improved due to loading only company-specific data

## Commands to Run if Issues Persist
```bash
# Clear all caches
php artisan optimize:clear

# Restart PHP-FPM
sudo systemctl restart php8.3-fpm

# Test company context
php public/test-company-context.php
```
