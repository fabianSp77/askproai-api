# Translation Feature Fix - 2025-07-05

## Issue
The translation button in the admin panel was throwing a 500 error when clicked.

## Root Cause
1. The translation endpoint was using API authentication (Sanctum) but being called from web-authenticated admin panel
2. Tenant scope was preventing admin users from accessing call data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created new AdminApiController
Created `/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AdminApiController.php` to handle admin API calls:
- Bypasses tenant scope using `withoutGlobalScope(\App\Scopes\TenantScope::class)`
- Uses web authentication instead of API authentication

### 2. Updated Routes
Added new route in `routes/web.php`:
```php
Route::middleware(['auth:web'])->prefix('admin-api')->group(function () {
    Route::post('/calls/{call}/translate-summary', [AdminApiController::class, 'translateCallSummary'])
        ->name('admin.api.calls.translate-summary');
});
```

### 3. Updated Blade Templates
Fixed JavaScript in:
- `/resources/views/filament/infolists/call-header-ultramodern.blade.php`
- `/resources/views/filament/infolists/call-header-optimized.blade.php`

Changed from hardcoded URL to proper route:
```javascript
fetch(`{{ route('admin.api.calls.translate-summary', ':id') }}`.replace(':id', callId), {
```

## Files Modified
1. `/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AdminApiController.php` (created)
2. `/routes/web.php`
3. `/resources/views/filament/infolists/call-header-ultramodern.blade.php`
4. `/resources/views/filament/infolists/call-header-optimized.blade.php`
5. `/resources/views/portal/calls/show-redesigned.blade.php`

## Testing
After clearing caches with `php artisan optimize:clear`, the translation button should work correctly in the admin panel.
