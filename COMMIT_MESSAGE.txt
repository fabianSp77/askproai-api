fix(critical): Handle NULL phoneNumber in getCallContext for anonymous callers

ISSUE:
  Anonymous callers were completely blocked from booking appointments.
  - Error: "Call context not found"
  - Root cause: phone_number_id = NULL → phoneNumber relationship NULL
  - Code tried to access $call->phoneNumber->company_id (crash on null)

IMPACT:
  - 100% failure rate for anonymous callers (~5-10% of traffic)
  - All function calls failed (initialize, availability, booking)
  - Estimated daily revenue loss: €50-100+

FIX:
  - Added null check in getCallContext() method
  - Use direct Call fields as fallback: company_id, branch_id
  - Only access phoneNumber relationship if it exists
  - Preserve backward compatibility with regular (non-anonymous) callers

FILES CHANGED:
  - app/Http/Controllers/RetellFunctionCallHandler.php
    - Lines 143-176: Enhanced getCallContext() with defensive checks
    - Added logging to distinguish normal vs anonymous call paths

TESTING:
  - Verified with production call #709 (anonymous caller)
  - company_id correctly retrieved from direct field
  - Phone_number_id correctly set to NULL for anonymous
  - No regression for non-anonymous calls

DEPLOYMENT:
  - Risk: VERY LOW (defensive programming only)
  - Breaking changes: NONE
  - Performance impact: NONE
  - Rollback: Easy (simple git revert if needed)

This fix restores booking functionality for 100% of anonymous callers.
