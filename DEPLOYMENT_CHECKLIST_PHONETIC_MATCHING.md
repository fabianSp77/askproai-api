# Deployment Checklist: Phone-Based Authentication mit Phonetic Matching

**Datum:** 2025-10-06
**Feature:** Phonetisches Namens-Matching f√ºr Telefon-authentifizierte Kunden
**Status:** ‚úÖ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT (Week 1 Complete)

---

## üìã Week 1: Production Deployment (Feature Flag OFF)

### Pre-Deployment Checks

- [x] ‚úÖ PhoneticMatcher Service implementiert (`app/Services/CustomerIdentification/PhoneticMatcher.php`)
- [x] ‚úÖ Unit Tests passing (22 passed, 58 assertions)
- [x] ‚úÖ Feature Flag Konfiguration erstellt (`config/features.php`)
- [x] ‚úÖ Controller-Erweiterungen implementiert (cancel + reschedule)
- [x] ‚úÖ Integration Tests erstellt (6 Kern-Szenarien validiert)
- [x] ‚úÖ `.env` konfiguriert mit `FEATURE_PHONETIC_MATCHING_ENABLED=false`

### Deployment Steps

**Step 1: Code Deployment**
```bash
# Git Status √ºberpr√ºfen
git status
git branch

# Alle Tests ausf√ºhren
php artisan test --filter=PhoneticMatcherTest
php artisan test --filter=PhoneBasedAuthenticationTest

# Configuration cache refresh
php artisan config:cache
php artisan config:clear

# Optional: Laravel cache clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

**Step 2: Environment Variable Verification**
```bash
# Verify Feature Flag is OFF
php artisan tinker --execute="echo 'FEATURE_PHONETIC_MATCHING_ENABLED: ' . (config('features.phonetic_matching_enabled') ? 'true' : 'false') . PHP_EOL;"

# Expected Output: "FEATURE_PHONETIC_MATCHING_ENABLED: false"
```

**Step 3: Monitoring Setup (Optional f√ºr Week 1)**
```sql
-- Verify phone-based authentication is working
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_calls,
    SUM(CASE WHEN customer_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as identified,
    SUM(CASE WHEN from_number != 'anonymous' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as with_phone
FROM calls
WHERE created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR);
```

### Post-Deployment Verification

**Checkpoint 1: Service Availability** (Immediately after deploy)
```bash
# Health check
curl -I https://api.askproai.de/admin/calls

# Verify no errors in logs
tail -n 50 storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -i "error\|exception"
```

**Checkpoint 2: Customer Identification Still Works** (30 min after deploy)
```sql
-- Verify customer identification rate unchanged
SELECT
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as total_calls,
    SUM(CASE WHEN customer_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as identified,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN customer_id IS NOT NULL THEN 100 ELSE 0 END), 2) as success_rate
FROM calls
WHERE created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 2 HOUR)
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);
```

**Checkpoint 3: No Regressions** (2 hours after deploy)
```bash
# Check for any new errors
php artisan log:show --level=error --since="2 hours ago"
```

### Rollback Plan

**If Issues Detected:**
```bash
# Rollback is NOT needed - feature is OFF
# Service is deployed but inactive

# If PhoneticMatcher causes issues:
# 1. Service is not called when feature flag is OFF
# 2. Check logs: grep "PhoneticMatcher" storage/logs/laravel.log

# Emergency: Revert code deployment
git revert <commit-hash>
php artisan config:cache
```

## üìã Week 2: Feature Activation (Test Company)

### Pre-Activation Checks

- [ ] Week 1 deployment stable for 7 days
- [ ] No regressions in customer identification
- [ ] Test company selected (ID to be determined)
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard prepared

### Activation Steps

**Step 1: Select Test Company**
```sql
-- Find suitable test company
SELECT
    id,
    name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) as total_customers,
    COUNT(DISTINCT calls.id) as total_calls_last_week
FROM companies
JOIN customers c ON c.company_id = companies.id
LEFT JOIN calls ON calls.company_id = companies.id
    AND calls.created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
WHERE companies.is_active = 1
GROUP BY companies.id
HAVING total_customers > 10 AND total_calls_last_week > 5
ORDER BY total_calls_last_week DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Step 2: Enable for Test Company**
```bash
# Update .env
FEATURE_PHONETIC_MATCHING_ENABLED=true
FEATURE_PHONETIC_MATCHING_TEST_COMPANIES="<test_company_id>"

# Refresh config
php artisan config:cache
```

**Step 3: Monitor Test Company**
```sql
-- Track name-matching statistics
SELECT
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as total_calls,
    SUM(CASE WHEN customer_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as identified,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN customer_id IS NOT NULL THEN 100 ELSE 0 END), 2) as success_rate
FROM calls
WHERE company_id = <test_company_id>
    AND created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);
```

### Success Criteria (Week 2)

- [ ] ‚úÖ Customer identification rate >= 90% (vs baseline)
- [ ] ‚úÖ No false positive identifications (wrong customer)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Phonetic matching logs show reasonable similarity scores
- [ ] ‚úÖ No performance degradation (response time < 200ms)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Test company feedback positive

---

## üìã Week 3: Gradual Rollout

### Rollout Plan

**Phase 1: 10% of Companies** (Day 11-12)
```bash
# Enable for all companies, no whitelist
FEATURE_PHONETIC_MATCHING_ENABLED=true
FEATURE_PHONETIC_MATCHING_TEST_COMPANIES=

# Monitor for 48 hours
```

**Phase 2: 50% of Companies** (Day 13)
- Monitor metrics
- Adjust threshold if needed (`FEATURE_PHONETIC_MATCHING_THRESHOLD`)

**Phase 3: 100% Rollout** (Day 14)
- Full production enablement
- Continue monitoring for 7 days

### Monitoring Queries

**Name-Mismatch Detection Rate**
```sql
SELECT
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as phone_auths,
    -- Note: Name mismatch data will be in logs, not database
    -- Use: grep "Name mismatch detected" storage/logs/laravel.log
FROM calls
WHERE from_number != 'anonymous'
    AND customer_id IS NOT NULL
    AND created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);
```

**Performance Monitoring**
```sql
-- Average response time (if tracking middleware installed)
SELECT
    endpoint,
    AVG(response_time_ms) as avg_ms,
    MAX(response_time_ms) as max_ms,
    COUNT(*) as requests
FROM api_requests
WHERE endpoint LIKE '%cancel-appointment%' OR endpoint LIKE '%reschedule-appointment%'
    AND created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)
GROUP BY endpoint;
```

## üîç Log Monitoring Commands

**Check Phonetic Matching Activity**
```bash
# See all phonetic matching events
grep "phonetic matching enabled" storage/logs/laravel.log | tail -50

# Check name mismatches
grep "Name mismatch detected" storage/logs/laravel.log | tail -50

# Check anonymous caller blocks
grep "Anonymous caller requires exact name match" storage/logs/laravel.log | tail -20
```

**Check Cross-Tenant Warnings**
```bash
grep "Cross-tenant customer" storage/logs/laravel.log | tail -20
```

## üéØ Success Metrics (Week 3 End)

### Target KPIs

- **Customer Identification Rate**: >= 95% (up from baseline ~85%)
- **False Positive Rate**: < 0.1% (monitored via customer complaints)
- **Performance**: Average response time < 150ms (no degradation)
- **Speech Recognition Errors Handled**: >= 80% of Call 691-type cases resolved

### Validation Query (End of Week 3)
```sql
-- Overall success rate comparison
SELECT
    'Before Feature' as period,
    COUNT(*) as total_calls,
    SUM(CASE WHEN customer_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as identified,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN customer_id IS NOT NULL THEN 100 ELSE 0 END), 2) as success_rate
FROM calls
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2025-09-01' AND '2025-10-05'
    AND from_number != 'anonymous'

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'After Feature' as period,
    COUNT(*) as total_calls,
    SUM(CASE WHEN customer_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as identified,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN customer_id IS NOT NULL THEN 100 ELSE 0 END), 2) as success_rate
FROM calls
WHERE created_at >= '2025-10-20'
    AND from_number != 'anonymous';
```
