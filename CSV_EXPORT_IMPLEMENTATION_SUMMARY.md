## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

   - Added `exportCsv()` method to handle CSV generation
   - Applies all current filters (search, status, date range, branch)
   - Respects user permissions for export and billing visibility
   - Generates CSV with semicolon delimiter (German standard)
   - Includes UTF-8 BOM for proper Excel encoding

2. **Route Addition** (`routes/business-portal.php`)
   - Added GET route: `/business/api/calls/export-csv`
   - Route name: `business.api.calls.export-csv`
   - Protected by authentication middleware

### Frontend Changes

1. **React Component Updates** (`resources/js/Pages/Portal/Calls/Index.jsx`)
   - Added `handleCsvExport()` function to trigger CSV downloads
   - Passes current filter parameters to the backend
   - Creates temporary download link with proper filename

2. **UI Enhancement**
   - Converted "Exportieren" button to dropdown menu
   - Added "Als CSV exportieren" option
   - Import DownOutlined icon for dropdown indicator
   - Maintains primary button styling

4. CSV file downloads automatically with all filtered data
5. File can be opened directly in Excel or other spreadsheet applications

## Testing

The feature has been built and is ready for testing:
1. Navigate to Business Portal â†’ Anrufe (Calls)
2. Apply any filters (optional)
3. Click the "Exportieren" dropdown button
4. Select "Als CSV exportieren"
5. CSV file should download with filtered data

## Next Steps

With both PDF (individual) and CSV (bulk) export features completed, the next high-priority items are:
1. **Translation Service Integration** - Enable multi-language support for call transcripts
2. **Column Preferences** - Allow users to customize which columns they see
3. **Smart Search** - Enhanced search functionality across all call data

The export features demonstrate a complete data export solution, giving users flexibility to export individual records as PDFs or bulk data as CSV files.
