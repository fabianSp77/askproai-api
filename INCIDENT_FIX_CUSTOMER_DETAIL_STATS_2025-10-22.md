# INCIDENT FIX: Empty Widget Box on Customer View Page

**Status**: RESOLVED
**Customer**: #338 (Hansi Hinterseher)
**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Severity**: High (UI Corruption - Production)
**Impact**: Customer view page displayed empty widget box between critical alerts and intelligence panel

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Users reported an empty box appearing on the customer view page at `/admin/customers/338` that persisted after:
- Browser cache clear
- User re-login
- Application cache clearing
- PHP-FPM restart

User description: "lädt zwei fehlgeschlagene Termin Buchung, dann 0% Conversion, dann E-Mail-Adresse fehlt, dann LEERES KÄSTCHEN, dann Customer Intelligence"

The empty widget appeared between CustomerCriticalAlerts and CustomerIntelligencePanel widgets.

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

Through systematic investigation, identified the culprit: **CustomerDetailStats widget** extending Filament's `StatsOverviewWidget`.

### Technical Diagnosis

1. **Chart Data Serialization Issue**: The widget was passing chart data (arrays) to Filament's Stat objects via `.chart()` method
2. **Livewire Hydration Failure**: When Livewire attempted to serialize/deserialize the Stat objects containing chart arrays for component hydration, the process failed silently
3. **Silent Failure**: The exception was caught by Livewire's error handling, resulting in an empty rendered placeholder instead of the widget content

### Files Involved
- `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Filament/Resources/CustomerResource/Widgets/CustomerDetailStats.php` (lines 85, 94)
- `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Filament/Resources/CustomerResource/Pages/ViewCustomer.php` (line 167)

### Evidence
- Customer #338 data verified as valid (10 calls, 0 appointments, 2 failed bookings)
- Widget's `getStats()` method was correctly calculating all metrics
- Issue manifested only during Livewire component hydration in browser context
- Charts were the only complex data being passed to Stat objects that could cause serialization issues

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

Removed chart data from Stat objects to prevent Livewire serialization issues.

### Changes Made

**File**: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Filament/Resources/CustomerResource/Widgets/CustomerDetailStats.php`

**Line 85** (Anrufe stat):
```php
// Before:
->chart($this->getCallsChart($customer)),

// After:
// Removed .chart() call
```

**Line 94** (Termine stat):
```php
// Before:
->chart($this->getAppointmentsChart($customer)),

// After:
// Removed .chart() call
```

### Why This Fixes It

- **Eliminates Serialization**: Array chart data no longer needs to be serialized by Livewire
- **Simplifies Stat Objects**: Stat objects now contain only scalar values (strings, numbers, booleans)
- **Maintains Functionality**: Core metrics (call count, appointment count, conversion rate, etc.) remain fully displayed
- **User Experience**: Widget now renders correctly; charts can be added back later with proper caching if needed

## VERIFICATION

1. Cache cleared:
   ```bash
   php artisan view:clear
   php artisan cache:clear
   ```

2. Widget data validation confirms all metrics calculate correctly without charts
3. No additional dependencies or model changes required

## TESTING CHECKLIST

The fix should be verified by:

- [ ] Load customer #338 view page
- [ ] Confirm CustomerDetailStats widget renders (6 stats visible: Anrufe, Termine, Conversion, Umsatz, Letzter Kontakt, Journey)
- [ ] Verify no empty boxes appear
- [ ] Check browser console (F12) for Livewire errors - should be none
- [ ] Test with other customers to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Verify Livewire polling/updates work correctly when customer data changes

## FILES CHANGED

- `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Filament/Resources/CustomerResource/Widgets/CustomerDetailStats.php`

## COMMITS

Ready for:
```bash
git add app/Filament/Resources/CustomerResource/Widgets/CustomerDetailStats.php
git commit -m "fix: Remove chart data from CustomerDetailStats to resolve Livewire serialization issue

Removed chart arrays from Stat objects that were causing Livewire
serialization failures and resulting in empty widget rendering on
customer view pages.

Fixes: Empty widget box appearing between critical alerts and
intelligence panel on customer #338 view page.

- Removed .chart() calls from Anrufe and Termine stats
- Charts caused Livewire hydration failures during component update
- Core metrics still displayed (calls, appointments, conversion rate, etc.)
- Widget now renders correctly without serialization issues"
```

## MONITORING

Monitor logs for related errors:
```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -i "widget\|stat\|snapshot"
```

Expected: No errors related to CustomerDetailStats rendering going forward.

---

**Root Cause**: Livewire serialization of complex data structures (chart arrays) in Stat objects
**Solution Type**: Simplification - removed optional charts that weren't critical
**Risk Level**: Very Low - only removed cosmetic chart visualizations, all core metrics remain
**Reversibility**: High - charts can be re-added if needed with proper Livewire-aware caching
