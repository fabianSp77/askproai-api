# Dashboard and Appointments Page Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-06-15

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Dashboard Empty White Box**
   - Fixed CallAnalyticsWidget by adding property_exists checks
   - Fixed BranchPerformanceWidget by changing is_active to active
   - Added null safety checks throughout widgets

2. **Route Not Defined Errors**
   - Fixed branches.map route error in ListBranches.php
   - Fixed staff.schedule route error in ListStaff.php
   - Replaced deprecated $this->notify() with Filament\Notifications\Notification::make()

3. **Appointments Page SQL Error**
   - Original error: "Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'service.price'"
   - Root cause: AppointmentResource was trying to access columns that don't exist in the database
   - The appointments table doesn't have service_id, branch_id, or price columns
   - Fixed by updating AppointmentResource to work with the actual database schema

### Database Schema Discovery:

The appointments table has these columns:
- id, call_id, tenant_id, customer_id, staff_id
- company_id, calcom_event_type_id, external_id
- calcom_v2_booking_id, starts_at, ends_at
- reminder_24h_sent_at, reminder_2h_sent_at, reminder_30m_sent_at
- payload, status, created_at, updated_at, metadata

Notable: NO service_id, branch_id, price, or notes columns exist!

### Solution Applied:

1. Created a new AppointmentResource that works with the actual database schema
2. Uses calcom_event_type_id instead of service_id
3. Removed references to non-existent columns (price, branch_id, service_id)
4. Updated filters and table columns to match actual relationships
5. Kept all essential functionality while working with existing data structure

### Files Modified:

1. `/app/Filament/Admin/Resources/AppointmentResource.php` - Completely rewritten
2. `/app/Filament/Admin/Resources/BranchResource/Pages/ListBranches.php` - Fixed notifications
3. `/app/Filament/Admin/Resources/StaffResource/Pages/ListStaff.php` - Fixed notifications
4. `/app/Filament/Admin/Widgets/CallAnalyticsWidget.php` - Added null checks

### Commands to Clear Cache:
```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan filament:clear-cached-components
```

### Next Steps:

1. Verify all pages load without errors
2. Consider database migration to add missing columns if needed
3. Update other resources that might have similar issues
4. Test all CRUD operations on appointments

### Important Notes:

- The system appears to be designed for Cal.com integration
- Appointments are linked to CalcomEventTypes, not direct services
- The payload field contains JSON data from Retell integration
- Customer relationships exist and work correctly
