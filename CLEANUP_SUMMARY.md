# Cleanup Summary - CallResource Fix

## What Was Fixed

### 1. CallResource Issues
- Fixed missing routes: Changed `getUrl('view')` to `getUrl('edit')` for CustomerResource and AppointmentResource
- Added missing methods in Call model: `extractEntities()` and `analyzeSentiment()`
- Removed duplicate `shouldRegisterNavigation` property

### 2. Cleanup Actions
- Removed all debug resources:
  - CallResourceDebug
  - CallResourceMinimal
  - CallResourceSimplified
- Removed all debug pages:
  - CallsDebug, DashboardDebug, DebugDashboard, DebugData, Debug, SessionTest
- Disabled debug middleware in bootstrap/app.php:
  - DebugRedirects
  - DebugLivewire
- Disabled debug JavaScript files in AdminPanelProvider
- Removed test HTML files and debug JavaScript files from public directory

## Current State
- CallResource is now using the standard ListCalls page with tabs
- All debug/test code has been removed
- The system should be running clean without any debug interference

## To Verify
1. Access `/admin` - should load without errors
2. Navigate to Calls page - should work without redirects
3. Test filters, pagination, and tabs - all should work properly

## If Issues Persist
Check the Laravel log for any remaining errors:
```bash
tail -f /var/www/api-gateway/storage/logs/laravel.log
