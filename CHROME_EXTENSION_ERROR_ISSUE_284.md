# Chrome Extension Error - GitHub Issue #284

## Error Message
```
Uncaught (in promise) Error: A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, 
but the message channel closed before a response was received
```

## Analysis
This error is **NOT** related to the AskProAI application itself. It's a Chrome browser error that occurs when:

1. A Chrome extension sends a message expecting an asynchronous response
2. The message listener returns `true` to indicate it will send a response later
3. The connection closes before the response is sent

## Common Causes
- Browser extensions (ad blockers, password managers, dev tools, etc.)
- Extensions that inject scripts into web pages
- Extensions that modify network requests
- Outdated or conflicting extensions

## This is NOT an Application Bug
This error:
- ❌ Does NOT affect the functionality of the AskProAI application
- ❌ Does NOT indicate a problem with the call detail page
- ❌ Does NOT require any code changes to fix
- ✅ Is entirely client-side in the user's browser

## Solutions for Users
1. **Disable Chrome Extensions**: Test in incognito mode (Ctrl+Shift+N) with extensions disabled
2. **Update Extensions**: Ensure all Chrome extensions are up to date
3. **Identify Problematic Extension**: 
   - Disable all extensions
   - Re-enable one by one to find the culprit
4. **Use Different Browser**: Test in Firefox, Safari, or Edge

## Developer Notes
- This error appears in the browser console but doesn't affect the application
- No code changes needed in AskProAI
- The error is from Chrome's extension messaging system, not our code
- Call detail page (call 258) functions normally despite this console error

## Conclusion
This is a browser-level issue with Chrome extensions, not an AskProAI bug. The call detail page and all functionality work correctly. Users experiencing this should check their browser extensions.
