# N+1 Query Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-06-28

### Fixed N+1 Query Issues in Filament Resources

#### 1. **CallResource.php**
- **Issue**: Missing eager loading for `agent` relationship
- **Fix**: Added `agent` to the with() clause in getEloquentQuery()
- **Before**: `->with(['customer', 'appointment', 'company'])`
- **After**: `->with(['customer', 'appointment', 'company', 'agent'])`

#### 2. **AppointmentResource.php**
- **Issue**: Missing eager loading for `branch`, `calcomEventType`, and `call` relationships
- **Fix**: Added missing relationships to the with() array in modifyQueryUsing()
- **Before**: `->with(['customer', 'staff', 'service'])`
- **After**: `->with(['customer', 'staff', 'service', 'branch', 'calcomEventType', 'call'])`

#### 3. **CustomerResource.php**
- **Issue**: The `last_appointment` column was executing a query for each row
- **Fix**: Optimized to use eager loaded appointments (limited to 1) instead of querying in the column
- **Changed eager loading**: From loading 5 appointments to loading only 1 (the latest)
- **Changed column**: From `$record->appointments()->latest('starts_at')->first()` to `$record->appointments->first()`

#### 4. **StaffResource.php**
- **Issue**: Missing eager loading for `company` and `homeBranch` relationships
- **Fix**: Added missing relationships to modifyQueryUsing()
- **Before**: Only had withCount() for appointments
- **After**: Added `->with(['company', 'homeBranch'])` before withCount()

#### 5. **BranchResource.php**
- **Issue**: Missing eager loading for `company` relationship
- **Fix**: Added modifyQueryUsing() with company eager loading
- **Before**: No query modification
- **After**: `->modifyQueryUsing(fn ($query) => $query->with(['company']))`

#### 6. **ServiceResource.php**
- **Issue**: Missing eager loading for `company` relationship
- **Fix**: Added modifyQueryUsing() with company eager loading
- **Before**: No query modification
- **After**: `->modifyQueryUsing(fn ($query) => $query->with(['company']))`

### Performance Impact
These fixes will significantly reduce the number of database queries when loading resource tables:
- Each N+1 query issue would execute 1 + N queries (where N is the number of rows)
- With eager loading, this is reduced to just 2 queries (main query + relationship query)
- For a table with 50 rows, this could reduce queries from 51 to 2 per relationship

### Verification
To verify these fixes work correctly:
1. Enable query logging in Laravel
2. Load each resource table page
3. Check the query log to ensure no duplicate queries for relationships
4. Monitor page load times - they should be noticeably faster

### Best Practices Applied
1. Always eager load relationships used in table columns
2. Use withCount() for aggregate data instead of loading full relationships
3. Avoid queries inside column getStateUsing() callbacks
4. Use collection methods on eager loaded data instead of querying again
