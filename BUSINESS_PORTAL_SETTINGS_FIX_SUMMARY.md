# Business Portal Settings Page Fix Summary

## Issue
The Settings page was showing a white screen with a 500 error when loading `/api/settings/company`. The React component was also showing an error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')".

## Root Cause
1. The error trace showed it was actually coming from the CallShow component, not the Settings page initially
2. The AuthContext wasn't finding user data in meta tags, resulting in `user` being null/undefined
3. API routes existed but weren't properly mapped in some cases

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added User Meta Tag to Layout
Added user information meta tag to `/resources/views/portal/layouts/app.blade.php`:
```blade
@auth('portal')
<meta name="user" content="{{ json_encode([
    'id' => auth()->guard('portal')->user()->id,
    'name' => auth()->guard('portal')->user()->name,
    'email' => auth()->guard('portal')->user()->email,
    'role' => auth()->guard('portal')->user()->role ?? 'user'
]) }}">
@endauth
```

### 2. Fixed Duplicate Method in CallApiController
Removed duplicate `authorizeViewCall` method definition that was causing PHP fatal error.

### 3. Created Missing FeedbackController
Created placeholder controller to fix route registration errors.

### 4. Verified API Endpoints
All settings API endpoints are working correctly:
- `/business/api/settings/profile` - Get user profile
- `/business/api/settings/company` - Get company data
- `/business/api/settings/call-notifications` - Get notification settings

### 5. Rebuilt Frontend Assets
Ran `npm run build` to ensure all changes are compiled.

## Testing Results
- Settings API endpoints return proper JSON responses
- User meta tag provides authentication context to React components
- No more white screen errors
- Call notification settings component loads properly

## Recommendations
1. Clear browser cache and do a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
2. Verify user is logged in before accessing settings
3. Check browser console for any remaining errors

The settings page should now load correctly without white screen errors.
