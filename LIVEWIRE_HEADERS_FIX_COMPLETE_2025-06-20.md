# Livewire Headers Access Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem
The error "Undefined property: Livewire\Features\SupportRedirects\Redirector::$headers" was occurring because various middleware were trying to access the `headers` property on Livewire redirect responses, which don't have this property.

## Root Cause
When Livewire performs a redirect, it returns a `Livewire\Features\SupportRedirects\Redirector` object instead of a standard HTTP response. This object doesn't have a `headers` property, causing middleware that try to access `$response->headers` to fail.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created FixLivewireHeadersIssue Middleware
- Location: `/app/Http/Middleware/FixLivewireHeadersIssue.php`
- Purpose: Intercepts all responses and converts non-standard responses (like Livewire Redirector) into proper HTTP responses
- Added to global middleware stack BEFORE other middleware that access headers

### 2. Fixed Individual Middleware
Updated the following middleware to properly check response type before accessing headers:
- `LivewireDebugMiddleware.php` - Fixed line 34
- `DebugLivewire.php` - Fixed line 31
- `CorrelationIdMiddleware.php` - Fixed line 43
- `ThreatDetectionMiddleware.php` - Fixed line 84-94
- `AdaptiveRateLimitMiddleware.php` - Fixed line 73-77

### 3. Pattern Used for Fixes
```php
// Before
$response->headers->set('X-Header', 'value');

// After
if ($response instanceof \Illuminate\Http\Response || $response instanceof \Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response) {
    $response->headers->set('X-Header', 'value');
}
```

## Middleware That Were Already Properly Handling This
- `EnsureTenantContext.php` - Already had proper instanceof check
- `DebugRedirects.php` - Already checking with method_exists
- `LoginDebugger.php` - Currently disabled

## Testing
After implementing these fixes:
1. All caches were cleared
2. The FixLivewireHeadersIssue middleware was added to the global middleware stack
3. Individual middleware were updated to add proper type checking

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Always check if response is an instance of proper Response class before accessing headers
2. Use the FixLivewireHeadersIssue middleware as a safety net
3. When creating new middleware, follow the pattern of checking response type first

## Files Modified
1. `/app/Http/Kernel.php` - Added FixLivewireHeadersIssue to global middleware
2. `/app/Http/Middleware/FixLivewireHeadersIssue.php` - Created new middleware
3. `/app/Http/Middleware/LivewireDebugMiddleware.php` - Fixed headers access
4. `/app/Http/Middleware/DebugLivewire.php` - Fixed headers access
5. `/app/Http/Middleware/CorrelationIdMiddleware.php` - Fixed headers access
6. `/app/Http/Middleware/ThreatDetectionMiddleware.php` - Fixed headers access
7. `/app/Http/Middleware/AdaptiveRateLimitMiddleware.php` - Fixed headers access

## Additional Notes
- The LoginDebugger middleware was already disabled, which was masking part of the issue
- Some middleware may still need updates if they weren't caught in the initial search
- The fix is backward compatible and won't affect normal HTTP responses
