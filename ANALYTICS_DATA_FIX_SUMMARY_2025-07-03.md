# Analytics Data Display Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-07-03

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Data Integrity Problem
- **Issue**: 144 calls were assigned to the wrong company_id
- **Root Cause**: Call import process didn't verify phone number ownership
- **Fix**: Corrected all call assignments based on phone number ownership
- **Result**: All calls now correctly assigned to the company that owns the phone number

### 2. Display Issues with Zero Data
- **Issue**: Average duration showed incorrect values when no calls existed
- **Root Cause**: `gmdate()` function was called with NULL/0 values
- **Fix**: Added conditional checks in the view to display "00:00" when no data exists
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/resources/views/portal/analytics/index.blade.php`
  - `/app/Http/Controllers/Portal/AnalyticsController.php`

### 3. Controller NULL Handling
- **Issue**: Controller returned NULL for averages and sums when no data existed
- **Fix**: Added `?: 0` to ensure numeric values are always returned
- **Result**: View always receives numeric values, preventing display errors

## Verification Results

```
Total calls in system: 146
Calls with correct company_id: 144
Calls with WRONG company_id: 0
Calls to unregistered numbers: 1
```

## Current Status
✅ Phone number filtering works correctly
✅ Analytics display correct data
✅ Zero values display properly formatted
✅ Data integrity restored

## Remaining Tasks
- Fix the call import process to prevent future data integrity issues
- Handle the 1 call to an unregistered number
- Add validation to ensure calls are always assigned to the correct company

## Test Cases
1. Company with no calls shows:
   - Total Calls: 0
   - Average Duration: 00:00
   - Total Duration: 00:00:00
   - Total Cost: 0,00 €

2. Phone number filtering:
   - Specific number selected: Only shows calls to that number
   - "All Numbers" selected: Only shows calls to company's numbers
   - No cross-company data exposure
