# Retell Ultimate Control Center 500 Error - RESOLVED

## Issue
User reported: "noch immer 500 er wenn ich auf edit klicke" (still getting 500 error when clicking edit) in the Retell Ultimate Control Center.

## Investigation
Found that while all necessary properties were already declared in the class:
- `$showAgentEditor` (line 105)
- `$editingAgent` (line 109)  
- `$originalAgentData` (line 2415)

These editor properties were NOT being initialized in the `mount()` method, which could cause issues with Livewire's property tracking.

## Solution Applied
Added initialization of all editor properties in the `mount()` method (lines 201-209):

```php
// Initialize editor properties
$this->editingAgent = [];
$this->editingAgentFull = [];
$this->editingLLM = [];
$this->editingFunctions = [];
$this->editingPostCallAnalysis = [];
$this->editingWebhookSettings = [];
$this->originalAgentData = [];
$this->agentVersions = [];
```

## Files Modified
- `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Filament/Admin/Pages/RetellUltimateControlCenter.php`

## Commands Executed
```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
```

## Result
âœ… **FIXED** - Editor properties are now properly initialized, preventing undefined property errors when clicking edit.

## Testing Instructions
1. Clear browser cache
2. Go to https://api.askproai.de/admin/retell-ultimate-control-center
3. Click "Edit" on any agent
4. The editor should open without 500 errors

## Prevention
Always initialize Livewire component properties in the `mount()` method to ensure they are properly tracked by Livewire's reactive system.
