# Call Detail Page - Complete Fix Implementation
**Date**: 2025-08-07  
**Issue**: GitHub #532 - Table showing above call details

## ‚úÖ PROBLEMS SOLVED

### 1. Table Removed from Detail Page
**Issue**: ViewRecord was inheriting and displaying a table above the call details  
**Solution**: Created custom Blade view that ONLY renders the infolist
- **File**: `/var/www/api-gateway/resources/views/filament/admin/resources/call-resource/pages/view-call.blade.php`
- **Change**: Custom view bypasses all table rendering
- **Result**: Clean detail page with only infolist components

### 2. Audio Player Functional
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented and working
- Professional HTML5 audio player with controls
- Download and copy URL functionality
- Supports MP3, WAV, MP4 formats
- Shows duration and call ID
- Fallback for missing recordings

### 3. Section Order Fixed
**As requested**: Analysis near top, Transcript at bottom
1. **Anruf-Details** - Main call information (top)
2. **Aufnahme** - Audio player (after details)
3. **Analyse** - Sentiment and appointments (near top)
4. **Kunde** - Customer information
5. **Notizen** - Notes system (prominently placed)
6. **Transkript** - Full transcript (bottom, collapsible)
7. **Technische Details** - System info (bottom, collapsed)

### 4. Notes System Fully Operational
**Database**: ‚úÖ call_notes table with 13 test notes
**Components**: ‚úÖ All files exist and working
- 7 note types with color-coded badges
- Add/delete functionality
- Real-time Livewire updates
- Permission-based deletion
