# AICallCenter Page Fix Complete

## Problem
The AICallCenter page had multiple issues:
1. Missing `active()` scope on RetellAgent model
2. Missing form initialization for campaign form
3. Incorrect assumptions about the page URL

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added active() Scope to RetellAgent Model
```php
public function scopeActive($query)
{
    return $query->where('is_active', true);
}
```

### 2. Fixed Form Initialization
Added proper form initialization in `AICallCenter.php`:
```php
public function mount(): void
{
    $this->fillForms();
}

protected function getForms(): array
{
    return [
        'form' => $this->makeForm()
            ->schema($this->getFormSchema())
            ->statePath('quickCallData')
            ->model($this->quickCallData),
        'campaignForm' => $this->makeForm()
            ->schema($this->getCampaignFormSchema())
            ->statePath('campaignData')
            ->model($this->campaignData),
    ];
}

protected function fillForms(): void
{
    $this->form->fill($this->quickCallData);
    $this->campaignForm->fill($this->campaignData);
}
```

### 3. Made getAvailableAgents() Defensive
- Added auth checks to prevent null pointer errors
- Removed reference to non-existent 'priority' column
- Handle cases where no agents are configured

## Page Access Information
- **URL**: `/admin/a-i-call-center` (not `/admin/ai-call-center`)
- **Navigation Group**: AI Tools
- **Navigation Label**: AI Call Center

## Technical Notes
- The page uses Filament's auto-discovery mechanism
- The slug is automatically generated from the class name: `AICallCenter` → `a-i-call-center`
- Both forms (quick call and campaign) are now properly initialized
- The page can be instantiated successfully

## Current Status
✅ All errors have been resolved
✅ Page should now be accessible at the correct URL
✅ Forms are properly initialized
