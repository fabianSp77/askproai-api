# CallResource Redirect Issue - Complete Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing Routes
**Problem**: CallResource was trying to link to non-existent 'view' pages
- `CustomerResource::getUrl('view', ...)` 
- `AppointmentResource::getUrl('view', ...)`

**Fix**: Changed all references to use 'edit' pages instead since AppointmentResource doesn't have a view page.

### 2. Missing Model Methods
**Problem**: Call model's boot() method was calling non-existent methods during save operations:
- `extractEntities()`
- `analyzeSentiment()`

**Fix**: Added these missing methods to the Call model:
- `extractEntities()` - Extracts phone numbers, emails, dates, and times from transcripts
- `analyzeSentiment()` - Simple sentiment analysis based on keyword matching

### 3. Duplicate Property Declaration
**Problem**: CallResource had duplicate `shouldRegisterNavigation` property declarations

**Fix**: Removed the duplicate declaration

## Files Modified
1. `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Filament/Admin/Resources/CallResource.php`
   - Fixed URL references from 'view' to 'edit'
   - Removed duplicate property declaration

2. `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Models/Call.php`
   - Added missing `extractEntities()` method
   - Added missing `analyzeSentiment()` method

## Root Cause Analysis
The redirects were happening because:
1. When rendering the table, Filament tried to generate URLs for the appointment and customer columns
2. These URLs pointed to non-existent routes (view pages that don't exist)
3. Additionally, when saving Call records, the model tried to call methods that didn't exist
4. These errors caused Filament to redirect to the dashboard as a fallback behavior

## Verification Steps
1. Clear all caches: `php artisan optimize:clear`
2. Reload PHP-FPM: `service php8.2-fpm reload`
3. Test the Calls page:
   - Filters should work without redirects
   - Pagination should work without redirects
   - Column sorting should work without redirects
   - Clicking on customer/appointment links should open edit pages

## Prevention
1. Always verify that linked resources have the corresponding pages defined
2. Ensure all methods called in model boot() or events actually exist
3. Use try-catch blocks in complex table column definitions to handle errors gracefully
