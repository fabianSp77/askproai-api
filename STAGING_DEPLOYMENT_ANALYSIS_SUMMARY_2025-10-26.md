# Staging Deployment Strategy - Executive Summary
**Date**: 2025-10-26 | **Status**: Complete | **Ready**: Yes

---

## Situation Analysis

### Current State
- **Production**: Single server (api.askproai.de), direct deployment from main branch
- **Testing**: Robust GitHub Actions pipeline (unit, integration, E2E, security, performance)
- **Feature Flags**: Implemented (config/features.php) - framework ready
- **Database**: Multi-tenant MySQL with row-level security
- **Infrastructure**: nginx + PHP-FPM + MySQL + Redis, well-organized

### Problem
- No staging environment for safe testing before production
- Feature flag system exists but never used for actual rollout
- Risk of deploying untested code to production
- No ability to validate customer portal feature before users see it

### Opportunity
- Establish production-grade staging environment
- Create repeatable deployment processes
- Implement safe, gradual rollout capability
- Prove feature flag system works for future features

---

## Solution Overview

### Three-Tier Deployment Architecture
```
Development (Local) → Staging (staging.askproai.de) → Production (api.askproai.de)
      ↓                        ↓                              ↓
Feature branches      Validation + QA          Feature flag OFF (safe)
GitHub Actions        Real data testing        Gradual rollout
Unit tests            40+ checklist items     Production-grade monitoring
```

### Key Components

**1. Infrastructure**
- Staging subdomain: staging.askproai.de (separate nginx vhost)
- Separate database: askproai_staging (identical schema to production)
- Redis namespacing: askpro_staging_* prefix (prevents cache collision)
- SSL certificate: Let's Encrypt (valid for testing)

**2. Automation**
- GitHub Actions: Staging deployment workflow (on feature/* branches)
- Deployment scripts: Deploy, sync, toggle feature flags
- CI/CD: All tests run before staging/production

**3. Feature Flags**
- Default: ALL features disabled (safe production default)
- Staging: Customer portal features enabled for testing
- Production: Disabled initially, gradual rollout via env vars
- Scope: Company-level rollout capability (test companies first)

**4. Testing**
- Pre-staging: GitHub Actions runs all tests (unit, integration, E2E, security)
- Staging: 40+ item validation checklist, QA manual testing
- Post-production: 24-hour monitoring period

**5. Rollback**
- Feature flag: Fastest (disable = instant 404)
- Code rollback: Git revert (5 minutes)
- Database rollback: migrate:rollback (1-2 minutes, if needed)

## Implementation Timeline

| Week | Phase | Owner | Status |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| **4 (Oct 26-30)** | Infrastructure Setup | DevOps | Ready |
| **5 (Nov 2-6)** | Deployment Automation | DevOps | Depends on Week 4 |
| **6 (Nov 9-13)** | Feature Development | Dev Team | In Progress |
| **7 (Nov 16-20)** | Staging Validation | QA + Dev | Depends on Week 6 |
| **8 (Nov 23-27)** | Production Deployment | DevOps | Depends on Week 7 |
| **9-12 (Nov 30-Dec 21)** | Gradual Rollout | Product | Depends on Week 8 |

**Total Duration**: 12 weeks (Oct 26 - Dec 21)
**Critical Path**: Infrastructure → Automation → Feature Dev → Testing → Deploy → Rollout

---

## Key Success Factors

### Technical
1. **Feature Flags Working**: Ensure FEATURE_CUSTOMER_PORTAL toggles properly
2. **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Verify users only see their company's data
3. **Database Sync**: Production data copying process reliable
4. **Performance**: Portal load time < 3 seconds
5. **Cache Isolation**: Redis prefix prevents production cache pollution

### Process
1. **Automated Testing**: All tests pass before any deployment
2. **Staging Validation**: Complete 40-item checklist before production
3. **Code Review**: 2 approvals before main merge
4. **Monitoring**: 24-hour post-deployment watch period
5. **Gradual Rollout**: Week-by-week customer group expansion

### Team
1. **Clear Communication**: Daily standup + Slack #deployments channel
2. **Documentation**: All procedures documented and accessible
3. **Runbook**: On-call engineer has step-by-step procedures
4. **Training**: Team trained on new deployment process
5. **Approval Gates**: Product, QA, DevOps sign-off at each stage

## Risk Mitigation Summary

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Database migration fails | Low | Test on staging first, rollback plan |
| Feature flag not working | Low | Test both ON and OFF states |
| Multi-tenant isolation broken | Low | Security tests in CI/CD, audit in staging |
| Production data exposed in staging | Medium | Sanitization script, separate credentials |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Baseline performance tests, monitoring |
| User authentication broken | Low | E2E login flow tests |
| Cache collision (staging/prod) | Low | Separate Redis prefixes |
| SSL certificate issues | Low | Pre-renewal monitoring |

**Overall Risk Level**: LOW (well-mitigated)

## Questions Answered

**Q: How long until we can test on staging?**
A: Week 4 (Oct 26-30) infrastructure setup, then ready by Nov 2.

**Q: What if staging tests find critical bugs?**
A: We fix on feature branch and re-test on staging (automated).

**Q: Can we deploy to production without staging validation?**
A: Not recommended, but feature flag allows safe rollback if needed.

**Q: When do customers see the portal?**
A: Week 6+ (Nov 30+), gradual rollout starting with 2-3 pilot companies.

**Q: What happens if production deployment fails?**
A: Disable FEATURE_CUSTOMER_PORTAL=false (instant 404), investigate root cause.

**Q: Do we need new servers?**
A: No, uses existing production server (same physical machine).

**Q: How much downtime during deployment?**
A: Zero - feature is feature-flagged OFF, users won't see any changes.

**Q: Can we pause rollout if issues arise?**
A: Yes - keep feature flag disabled for those users.
