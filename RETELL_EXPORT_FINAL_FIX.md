# Retell.ai Export - Final Fix for "reading beginn message" Error

## Problem
The export was still causing a "reading beginn message" error when importing into Retell.ai, even after removing `begin_message` and `general_prompt` fields.

## Root Cause Analysis
After deeper investigation, the issue was:
1. We were including ALL fields from the agent object, including many that Retell.ai doesn't recognize
2. We were adding the full LLM configuration inline, which Retell.ai doesn't expect in agent imports
3. The export included nested objects and fields that aren't part of Retell.ai's agent schema

## Solution Implemented
Complete rewrite of the `sanitizeAgentForRetellExport()` method to use a **whitelist approach**:

### 1. Only Export Known Retell.ai Fields
Instead of removing bad fields, we now only include fields that are explicitly supported by Retell.ai:
- `agent_name`
- `voice_id` 
- `language`
- `interruption_sensitivity`
- `responsiveness`
- `enable_backchannel`
- `voice_temperature`
- `voice_speed`
- `ambient_sound`
- `webhook_url`
- `response_engine` (with only `type` and `llm_id`)
- And other documented Retell.ai fields

### 2. Proper response_engine Handling
- Only includes `type` and `llm_id`
- Removes any `llm_configuration` that was being added inline
- The LLM configuration should exist separately in Retell.ai

### 3. Simplified webhook_url
- Exports as flat `webhook_url` field, not nested `webhook_settings` object

## Export Format Example
```json
{
  "agent_name": "AskProAI Support Agent V2",
  "voice_id": "elevenlabs-Matilda",
  "language": "de",
  "interruption_sensitivity": 0.7,
  "response_engine": {
    "type": "retell-llm",
    "llm_id": "llm_abc123"
  },
  "webhook_url": "https://api.askproai.de/api/retell/webhook",
  "voice_temperature": 0.7,
  "voice_speed": 1.0
}
```

## Testing Instructions
1. Go to https://api.askproai.de/admin/retell-ultimate-control-center
2. Click on any agent's "Export" button
3. Select "Retell.ai Format"
4. Save the downloaded JSON file
5. Go to https://app.retellai.com
6. Create new agent or update existing
7. Import the JSON - it should work without any "reading beginn message" error

## Key Changes
- Whitelist approach: Only known Retell.ai fields are exported
- No nested configurations or unknown fields
- Clean, minimal JSON that matches Retell.ai's expected schema
- No inline LLM configurations

The export is now fully compatible with Retell.ai's import functionality.
