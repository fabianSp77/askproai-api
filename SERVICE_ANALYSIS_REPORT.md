# üìä Service Analysis Report - Cal.com & Retell Services

## Executive Summary
After analyzing the codebase, I found multiple Cal.com and Retell services with varying levels of usage and redundancy. Most services marked for deletion are indeed safe to remove, but some require careful migration.

## üîç Cal.com Services Analysis

  - `CalendarProviders/CalcomProvider.php`
  - `OnboardingWizard.php`
  - Several jobs: `ProcessRetellCallJob`, `ProcessRetellWebhookJob`, `WarmCacheJob`
- **Risk**: HIGH - Removing this would break multiple features
- **Recommendation**: DO NOT DELETE until all usages are migrated to CalcomV2Service

### 2. **CalcomV2Service.php** (KEEP)

3. **Migration incomplete** - Need to update:

   - Various jobs
4. **RetellService has active references** - Needs migration before deletion

## üìã Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Safe Deletions (No Dependencies)
```bash
# These can be deleted immediately:
rm app/Services/CalcomDebugService.php
rm app/Services/CalcomImportService.php
rm app/Services/CalcomSyncService.php
rm app/Services/CalcomUnifiedService.php
rm app/Services/CalcomV2MigrationService.php
rm app/Services/RetellAgentService.php
rm app/Services/RetellAIService.php
rm app/Services/RetellV1Service.php
```

### Phase 2: Migration Required
1. Update all CalcomService usages to use CalcomV2Service
2. Update RetellService usages to use RetellV2Service
3. Test thoroughly, especially:
   - Appointment booking flow
   - Onboarding wizard
   - Call data refresh
   - Webhook processing

### Phase 3: Final Cleanup
Only after Phase 2 is complete and tested:
```bash
rm app/Services/CalcomService.php
rm app/Services/CalcomEventSyncService.php
rm app/Services/CalcomEventTypeImportService.php
rm app/Services/CalcomEventTypeSyncService.php
rm app/Services/RetellService.php
# Note: AppointmentService.php needs deeper refactoring before removal
```
