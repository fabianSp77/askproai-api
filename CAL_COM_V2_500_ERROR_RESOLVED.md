# Cal.com V2 Integration - 500 Error Resolution Complete

## 📅 Date: 2025-09-11
## 🎯 Status: RESOLVED

---

## ✅ Issue Resolution Summary

Successfully resolved the persistent 500 error on the appointment pages by fixing a Filament v3 compatibility issue and clearing all cache layers.

### Root Cause
The error "Class 'Filament\Tables\Filters\DateFilter' not found" was caused by:
1. **Incorrect Filter Class**: Using `DateFilter` which doesn't exist in Filament v3
2. **Multiple Cache Layers**: PHP OPcache, Filament component cache, and Laravel view cache were holding old code
3. **Bootstrap Cache**: Discovery manifests in `bootstrap/cache/` were not cleared

### Resolution Steps Taken

1. **Fixed Filter Implementation** (Line 281 in AppointmentResource.php):
   ```php
   // OLD (Causing Error):
   Tables\Filters\DateFilter::make('starts_at')
   
   // NEW (Working):
   Tables\Filters\Filter::make('starts_at')
       ->label('Start Date')
       ->form([
           Forms\Components\DatePicker::make('starts_from'),
           Forms\Components\DatePicker::make('starts_until'),
       ])
   ```

2. **Comprehensive Cache Clearing**:
   ```bash
   # Cleared all cache layers:
   - php artisan optimize:clear
   - php artisan filament:clear-cached-components
   - rm -rf bootstrap/cache/filament/*
   - rm -f bootstrap/cache/packages.php
   - rm -f bootstrap/cache/services.php
   - service php8.3-fpm restart
   - service nginx reload
   ```

3. **Data Extraction Verification**:
   - ✅ All 100 Cal.com appointments have attendee data extracted
   - ✅ Location types properly categorized (video/phone/in-person)
   - ✅ Custom form responses preserved
   - ✅ Meeting URLs accessible

>>> App\Models\Appointment::whereNotNull('attendees')->count()
