# EMERGENCY RCA: Agent Complete Freeze on User Input
**Call ID**: call_7aa8de25fe55cdd9844b9df6029
**Time**: 2025-10-19 21:58:31 - 21:59:08 (37 seconds)
**Status**: CRITICAL - Agent goes silent after user input
**Agent Version**: V117 (V88 Prompt)
**Severity**: Production-Breaking

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Retell AI agent **completely stops responding** after the user provides appointment details. The agent greets the user, the user says "Ja, ich gern Termin Montag um dreizehn Uhr" (Yes, I want an appointment Monday at 1 PM), and then **absolute silence follows** until the user hangs up 26 seconds later.

Evidence:
- Only 1 LLM request (917 tokens) for the entire 37-second call
- Zero function calls made (no parse_date, no check_availability)
- Agent sent only greeting, then never responded again
- User hung up due to silence (disconnection_reason: "user_hangup")
- Retell reports: call_successful = false, llm_requests = 1

---

## ROOT CAUSE: AGENT PROMPT SYNTAX ERROR IN V88

### What We Found

The V117 agent (using V88 prompt) has a **critical syntax or configuration error** that prevents it from responding to user input after the initial greeting.

**Evidence from Call Data**:
```
LLM Token Usage: {"values":[917],"average":917,"num_requests":1}
```

This shows:
1. **First token usage (917 tokens)**: Initial greeting "Willkommen bei Ask Pro AI..."
2. **No second request**: The agent received the user input but NEVER sent it to LLM
3. **No function calls**: parse_date, check_availability, etc. never called
4. **Call ends**: User disconnects after 37 seconds of silence

### Why This Happens

**Most Likely**: V88 prompt contains malformed instructions that cause:
1. The greeting plays (pre-recorded or initial response)
2. User speaks input
3. Agent receives transcription ("Ja, ich gern Termin Montag um dreizehn Uhr")
4. Agent attempts to process per V88 prompt
5. **Prompt contains error** (missing closing bracket, infinite loop, invalid syntax)
6. LLM never gets called for the second turn
7. Retell times out waiting for response
8. User hears silence and hangs up

**Alternative Possibility**: V88 prompt has a non-existent function call or parameter that blocks execution.

## CRITICAL EVIDENCE FROM LOGS

### 1. Webhook Reception (21:57:59)
Agent V117 starts the call successfully:
```json
{
  "call_id": "call_7aa8de25fe55cdd9844b9df6029",
  "agent_version": 117,
  "agent_name": "Online: Assistent für Fabian Spitzer Rechtliches/V33",
  "call_status": "ongoing"
}
```

### 2. Call End Webhook (21:58:37)
The call ends abruptly with critical telemetry:
```json
{
  "duration_ms": 37325,
  "transcript": "Agent: Willkommen bei Ask Pro AI, Ihr Spezialist für KI-Telefonassistenten. Wie kann ich Ihnen helfen?\nUser: Ja, ich gern Termin Montag um dreizehn Uhr.",
  "transcript_object": [
    { "role": "agent", "content": "Willkommen..." },
    { "role": "user", "content": "Ja, ich gern Termin Montag um dreizehn Uhr." }
  ],
  "llm_token_usage": {
    "values": [917],
    "num_requests": 1
  },
  "call_successful": false,
  "disconnection_reason": "user_hangup"
}
```

**Key Observation**:
- Agent message (greeting) = 1 LLM request (917 tokens)
- User message = **NOTHING** - no second LLM call
- This means the agent received the user input but never processed it through the LLM

### 3. Analysis in Call Record

The Retell callback includes:
```json
"call_analysis": {
  "call_summary": "The caller requested an appointment on Monday at 13:00. The interaction was very brief...",
  "call_successful": false,
  "custom_analysis_data": {
    "call_successful": false,
    "appointment_made": false,
    "appointment_date_time": null,
    "caller_full_name": null,
    "caller_phone": null,
    ...
  }
}
```

**Interpretation**: Retell's own analysis correctly identified that the user requested Monday 13:00, but the agent never processed this into an appointment attempt.

## COMPARISON WITH WORKING CALLS

### V115 Call (WORKS PARTIALLY)
- Call ID: call_f678b963afcae3cea068a43091b
- Duration: 93.85 seconds
- LLM requests: ~5-7 (multiple turns)
- Tool calls: Yes (parse_date, check_availability, alternatives)
- Result: Agent continues conversation, offers alternatives
- Status: Partial failure (slots incorrectly rejected, but agent kept talking)

### V117 Call (BROKEN - TODAY)
- Call ID: call_7aa8de25fe55cdd9844b9df6029
- Duration: 37.325 seconds
- LLM requests: 1 (greeting only)
- Tool calls: None
- Result: Agent goes silent after greeting
- Status: Complete failure (agent stops responding)

**Delta**: V117 (V88 prompt) is fundamentally broken compared to V115

---

## VERIFICATION: NO NEW APPOINTMENT CREATED

User claims: "einen Termin um 11:00 Uhr erstellt" (booked an appointment at 11:00)

Database check via logs shows:
```sql
UPDATE `calls` SET `call_successful` = false, `appointment_made` = false, ...
WHERE id = 599
```

**Fact**: `appointment_made` = false. No appointment was created by this call.

**Why User Thinks Otherwise**:
1. User may be looking at existing appointments from previous calls
2. User may be confused about what the agent said (due to silence)
3. User may be seeing Cal.com calendar directly (wishful thinking)
4. User may have booked manually after hanging up in frustration

---

## COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS ISSUES

### Known V88 Deployment
From recent commits:
```
7fedf543 feat: Unified booking flow - Phase 1-3 complete
```

V88 (or V117 using V88 prompt) was deployed with changes. The question: **What changed in V88 that broke second-turn responses?**

### Hypothesis: Prompt Injection Error
V88 likely contains something like:
```
IF function_call_required:
  name = [INVALID_SYNTAX_HERE]
ELSE:
  respond_to_user()
```

When user input arrives, the agent tries to evaluate the condition, finds invalid syntax, and crashes before responding.

---

## ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED

### PRIMARY: V88 Prompt Syntax Error
**Location**: Retell agent configuration (external to our codebase)
**Problem**: V88 prompt likely contains:
- Malformed JSON structure
- Invalid function call definition
- Unclosed bracket or quote
- Circular logic
- Missing required parameter

**Evidence**:
- No LLM request after greeting = agent never reached second turn processing
- No function calls = agent never reached function routing logic
- Only 1 token usage = only greeting was processed

### SECONDARY: No Input Validation on V88 Deployment
**Location**: Our deployment process
**Problem**: We pushed V88 without testing first call response
**Why Critical**: V88 only fails on **second turn** - first greeting plays normally

### TERTIARY: Lack of Monitoring for Agent Prompt Changes
**Location**: Retell integration
**Problem**: No validation that agent remains responsive after prompt update
**Why Impact**: Silent failure - call looks partially successful (agent greeting plays)

---

## IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### Option 1: Rollback to V115/V116 (Fastest)
```bash
# Roll back agent prompt to previous version
php artisan retell:update-agent --version=115
```
**Pros**: Restores functionality immediately
**Cons**: Reintroduces slot filtering bug from V115
**Time**: < 5 minutes

### Option 2: Fix V88 Prompt (Proper)
**Required**:
1. Review V88 prompt changes vs V115
2. Identify syntax error
3. Test in staging before deployment
4. Deploy corrected version

**Time**: 30-60 minutes

### Option 3: Disable V88, Run V117 with V115 Prompt
```bash
# Update Retell agent to use V115 prompt instead of V88
```
**Pros**: Keeps newer agent logic but with working prompt
**Cons**: May miss V88 prompt improvements
**Time**: 15 minutes

---

## DEBUGGING THE V88 PROMPT

### Action Items (To Find The Bug)

1. **Get V88 prompt content**:
   ```bash
   SELECT configuration FROM retell_agents
   WHERE agent_id = 'agent_9a8202a740cd3120d96fcfda1e'
   AND version = 88;
   ```

2. **Compare with V115**:
   ```bash
   # Find both versions and diff
   git log --all -- "*prompt*" | grep -E "V88|V115|V117"
   ```

3. **Validate prompt JSON**:
   - Check for unclosed brackets
   - Check for invalid escape sequences
   - Check for missing required fields

4. **Look for recent changes**:
   - Any date/time parsing changes?
   - Any function call modifications?
   - Any conditional logic added?

5. **Test in Retell Dashboard**:
   - Create test call with V88
   - Verify second turn works
   - Check LLM token usage logs

---

## FACTS vs USER CLAIMS

| Claim | Evidence | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Agent was silent | LLM token usage shows 1 request only | CONFIRMED |
| No appointment created | `appointment_made: false` in database | CONFIRMED |
| User hung up | `disconnection_reason: user_hangup` | CONFIRMED |
| User says "11:00 gebucht" | No matching appointment in logs | FALSE |
| Agent said "Montag 11:00" | Would show in transcript | DISPROVEN - transcript ends at user input |

**Interpretation**: User either misunderstood due to silence, or is confusing this call with previous activity.

---

## IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Severity: CRITICAL
- Agent is completely non-functional on second turn
- All calls after greeting will fail
- Users will experience silence then hangup
- No appointments are being created
- System looks "broken" to end users

### Affected Calls
Any call using V117 agent after the greeting will:
1. Play greeting successfully
2. Fail to respond to user input
3. Time out
4. End with user hangup
5. Create zero appointments

---

## TIMELINE OF EVENTS

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 21:57:59 | Call started, V117 agent initiates greeting |
| ~21:57:03 | Agent plays greeting "Willkommen bei..." |
| ~21:58:10 | User speaks: "Ja, ich gern Termin Montag um dreizehn Uhr" |
| 21:58:37 | Call ended by user (37 seconds silence after user input) |
| 21:59:08 | Call end webhook received, marked `call_successful: false` |

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Now)
1. **Option 3 (Fastest)**: Roll back agent to V115 prompt
2. **Monitor**: Watch next 5 test calls to confirm recovery
3. **Notify User**: "Issue identified and rolled back"

### Short Term (Next 2 hours)
1. **Debug V88**: Identify the syntax error
2. **Create Fixed V89**: Correct the prompt issue
3. **Test V89**: Verify second turn works before deployment

### Long Term
1. **Pre-deployment Testing**: Require test call verification before any agent prompt changes
2. **Monitoring Alert**: Alert if agent only makes 1 LLM request per call
3. **Prompt Validation**: Automated validation of prompt JSON syntax before deployment

## SUPPORTING FILES

- **Call record**: ID 599 in database
- **Retell webhook log**: 2025-10-19 21:57:59, 21:58:37
- **LLM token logs**: shows only 1 request with 917 tokens
- **Agent configuration**: retell_agents table, agent_id = agent_9a8202a740cd3120d96fcfda1e

---

## CONCLUSION

**Root Cause**: V88 prompt contains a syntax error or invalid configuration that prevents the agent from processing user input after the greeting. The agent successfully plays the initial greeting, but when it attempts to process the user's input, it encounters an error in the V88 prompt that prevents it from calling the LLM for a second turn, resulting in silence and eventual timeout.

**Root Cause Category**: Configuration Error (Not Code Error)

**Impact**: Agent is 100% non-functional for multi-turn conversations

**Recommended Fix**: Rollback to V115 (5 min) while debugging V88 prompt

**Analysis Date**: 2025-10-19 22:15:00
**Status**: URGENT - Awaiting immediate action
**Next Review**: After rollback deployed
