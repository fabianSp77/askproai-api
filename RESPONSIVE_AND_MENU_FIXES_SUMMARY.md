# Responsive and Menu Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Icon Sizing Problem
**Issue**: Large icons were blocking the page view
**Root Cause**: Icon containers had no defined dimensions, causing SVGs to expand uncontrollably
**Solution**: Created `icon-container-sizes.css` with proper container dimensions for different icon contexts

### 2. Mobile Navigation Console Error
**Issue**: Console error "Mobile navigation component not found"
**Root Cause**: `mobile-navigation-fix.js` was looking for a component that didn't exist
**Solution**: Updated the JavaScript to work with the simplified mobile navigation button

## Implementation Details

- Base icons: 20px (1.25rem)
