# Retell Webhook Configuration Summary

## Current Status (as of check)

### ✅ What's Configured Correctly:
1. **Webhook URL Updated**: The Retell agent is now configured to send webhooks to the MCP endpoint:
   - URL: `https://api.askproai.de/api/mcp/webhook/retell`
   - This is the CORRECT MCP webhook handler

2. **MCP Infrastructure Ready**:
   - MCPWebhookController exists at the correct location
   - Route is properly registered (`mcp.webhook.retell`)
   - Database table `retell_webhooks` exists for storing webhooks

3. **Webhook Events Enabled**: 
   - Events configured: `call_started`, `call_ended`, `call_analyzed`
   - Note: Retell API might not show these in responses, but they should be active

### ❌ Issues Found:
1. **No Webhooks in MCP Table**: The `retell_webhooks` table is empty, indicating webhooks are not being processed by MCP
2. **Old System Still Processing**: Recent calls exist in the `calls` table with timestamps from today
3. **Route Confusion**: Multiple webhook endpoints exist, causing confusion

## Route Mapping

| Route | Handler | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `/api/retell/webhook` | RetellWebhookController | OLD system (currently receiving webhooks) |
| `/api/mcp/retell/webhook` | Redirects to OLD controller | Temporary redirect (WRONG) |
| `/api/mcp/webhook/retell` | MCPWebhookController | NEW MCP system (CORRECT) |

## What Was Done

1. **Updated Retell Agent Configuration**:
   ```
   OLD: https://api.askproai.de/api/retell/webhook
   NEW: https://api.askproai.de/api/mcp/webhook/retell
   ```

2. **Enabled Webhook Events**:
   - call_started
   - call_ended
   - call_analyzed

## Next Steps to Verify

1. **Make a Test Call**:
   ```bash
   # Call the configured phone number
   +49 30 837 93 369
   ```

2. **Monitor MCP Webhook Table**:
   ```bash
   # Watch for new entries
   watch -n 2 'mysql -u askproai_user -p"lkZ57Dju9EDjrMxn" askproai_db -e "SELECT * FROM retell_webhooks ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;"'
   ```

3. **Check Logs**:
   ```bash
   # MCP logs
   tail -f storage/logs/mcp-server.log
   
   # Laravel logs for MCP activity
   tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -i "mcp.*webhook"
   ```

4. **Verify No More Old System Webhooks**:
   ```bash
   # Check if old system stops receiving new webhooks
   mysql -u askproai_user -p"lkZ57Dju9EDjrMxn" askproai_db -e "SELECT MAX(created_at) as last_webhook FROM calls;"
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If webhooks are still not appearing in MCP:

1. **Check Signature Verification**: The MCP endpoint might be rejecting webhooks due to signature mismatch
2. **Restart Services**:
   ```bash
   php artisan queue:restart
   supervisorctl restart all
   ```
3. **Clear Cache**:
   ```bash
   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan config:clear
   ```

## Important Notes

- The webhook URL change in Retell can take a few minutes to propagate
- Make sure to test with actual phone calls, not just API tests
- The MCP system stores webhooks in `retell_webhooks` table, NOT the `calls` table
- Signature verification is required for production security
