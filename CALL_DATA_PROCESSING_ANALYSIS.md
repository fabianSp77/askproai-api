# Call Data Processing Analysis & Fixes

## Problem Analysis

### Issues Found:
1. **Double JSON Encoding**: Raw data was stored as double-encoded JSON strings
2. **Missing Data Fields**: 
   - `from_number` was empty in all calls
   - `to_number` was missing in many calls
   - `duration_sec` was not being saved
   - `audio_url` not captured
   - `cost` information not saved
3. **Incorrect Field Mapping**: Using wrong field names from Retell webhook
4. **No Analysis**: Call analysis was not being performed

## Data Flow

### Retell Webhook Structure
```json
{
    "call_id": "retell_xxxxx",
    "from": "+491234567890",        // NOT "from_number"
    "to": "+493083793369",           // NOT "to_number"
    "duration": 120,                 // NOT "duration_sec"
    "transcript": "...",
    "summary": "...",
    "call_successful": true,
    "audio_url": "https://...",
    "cost": 0.15,
    "agent_id": "agent_xxx",
    "_datum__termin": "2025-06-15",  // Custom fields
    "_uhrzeit__termin": "14:00"
}
```

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Double Encoding
Created `fix_call_data.php` script that:
- Detected and fixed double-encoded JSON
- Extracted missing fields from raw_data
- Updated 65 calls successfully

### 2. Updated ProcessRetellWebhookJob
```php
// Correct field mapping
'from_number' => $this->data['from'] ?? $this->data['phone_number'] ?? null,
'to_number' => $this->data['to'] ?? $this->data['to_number'] ?? null,
'duration_sec' => $this->data['duration'] ?? $this->data['duration_sec'] ?? 0,
'audio_url' => $this->data['audio_url'] ?? $this->data['recording_url'] ?? null,
'cost' => $this->data['cost'] ?? null,
```

### 3. Enhanced CallResource Display
- **Duration Column**: Now shows formatted time (m:ss) with color coding
  - Green: >= 3 minutes (good conversation)
  - Yellow: >= 1 minute (normal)
  - Gray: < 1 minute (short call)
- **Cost Column**: Added with EUR formatting
- **Branch/Company Columns**: Added for multi-tenant visibility

### 4. Created Webhook Analysis Page
New admin page at `/admin/webhook-analysis` showing:
- Call data completeness statistics
- Missing data report for recent calls
- Webhook structure analysis
- Data quality metrics

## Current Data Quality

### Statistics (from 123 total calls):
- With Transcript: 3 calls (2%)
- With Duration: 6 calls (5%)
- With Branch: 33 calls (27%)
- With Recording: 0 calls (0%)
- With Analysis: 3 calls (2%)

### Key Findings:
- Most calls are test data without real Retell webhook data
- Branch assignment working well (27% have branches)
- Need to implement audio recording capture
- Analysis should be triggered when transcript available

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions
- ✅ Fixed data mapping in webhook processor
- ✅ Added proper field display in admin
- ✅ Created analysis tools

### 2. Next Steps
- Implement automatic call analysis when transcript is available
- Add webhook retry mechanism for failed processing
- Create data quality monitoring alerts
- Implement audio recording download/storage

### 3. Long-term Improvements
- Add real-time webhook debugging
- Implement data validation rules
- Create automated data quality reports
- Add webhook replay capability

## Testing

### Manual Test Webhook
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/retell/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Retell-Signature: xxx" \
  -d '{
    "call_id": "test_123",
    "from": "+491234567890",
    "to": "+493083793369",
    "duration": 180,
    "transcript": "Test conversation transcript",
    "summary": "Customer wants appointment",
    "audio_url": "https://example.com/audio.mp3",
    "cost": 0.25,
    "call_successful": true
  }'
```
