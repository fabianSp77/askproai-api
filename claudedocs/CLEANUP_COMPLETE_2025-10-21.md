## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Command Used
```bash
php artisan staff:cleanup-and-duplicate-fabian
```

**Location**: `app/Console/Commands/StaffCleanupAndDuplicateFabian.php`

### Key Features
1. **Idempotent**: Safe to re-run (checks for existing records)
2. **Comprehensive**: 5 phases with validation
3. **Non-destructive**: Uses soft deletes (data recoverable)
4. **Detailed Output**: Phase-by-phase console reporting

## 🎯 UI & Filament Status

### Service 47 Edit Form
- ✅ RelationManager simplified (no callback-related 500-errors)
- ✅ Staff tab loads without errors
- ✅ Fabian visible in staff list
- ✅ Pivot data (is_primary, can_book) accessible

### Staff Relation Manager
**File**: `app/Filament/Resources/ServiceResource/RelationManagers/StaffRelationManager.php`

**Changes**:
- Reduced from 370+ lines to ~55 lines (minimal working version)
- Removed complex callbacks that caused Livewire rendering issues
- Maintained all essential functionality
- Safe formatStateUsing() for display-only fields

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (By Design)

### Current Architecture
```
❌ Staff model has single company_id column
❌ Cross-company assignments work but not "official"
⏳ Future: Many-to-Many pivot tables needed
```

**Workaround Applied**: Removed company filtering from Staff Select to allow cross-company assignments

**Future Implementation**: See `claudedocs/08_REFERENCE/MULTI_COMPANY_STAFF_ARCHITECTURE.md`

## 🚀 Next Steps

### If Retell Integration Needed
1. Service 47 is ready with correct staff (Fabian)
2. Cal.com hosts sync: `php artisan calcom:sync-service-hosts --service-id=47`
3. Test Retell voice flow: `/admin/services/47` → Test Booking

### If More Cleanup Needed
```bash
# Run again safely (idempotent)
php artisan staff:cleanup-and-duplicate-fabian

# Verify no lingering issues
php artisan tinker
>>> \App\Models\Staff::where('is_active', true)->count()  # Should be 2
```

### If Services 41 & 42 Need Review
```bash
# Check what staff/services need assignment
php artisan tinker
>>> \App\Models\Service::whereIn('id', [41, 42])->with('staff')->get()
```
