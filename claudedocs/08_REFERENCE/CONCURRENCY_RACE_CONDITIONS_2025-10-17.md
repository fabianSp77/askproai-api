# AskPro AI Gateway - Concurrency & Race Condition Analysis Report

**Date**: 2025-10-17  
**Scope**: Production-impacting race conditions in appointment creation, availability checking, and synchronization flows  
**Confidence Level**: High (based on code review of critical paths)

---

## Executive Summary

The AskPro AI Gateway has **5 CRITICAL race condition scenarios** with HIGH probability and HIGH impact, **8 MEDIUM-RISK scenarios**, and several existing locking mechanisms. The primary vulnerabilities stem from:

1. **Check-then-act patterns** without atomic operations (availability checks before booking)
2. **Cache-based slot availability** with short TTL causing stale data reads
3. **Cross-system synchronization** without idempotency keys on Cal.com side
4. **Weak duplicate prevention** relying on application-level checks instead of database constraints
5. **Incomplete transaction boundaries** in multi-step booking operations

The system has deployed some mitigations (unique constraints, duplicate detection, locking service) but critical gaps remain in the fast path for Retell AI voice bookings.

## CRITICAL Race Condition Scenarios (HIGH PROBABILITY × HIGH IMPACT)

### RC1: Double-Booking Via Concurrent Availability Check & Creation

**Severity**: CRITICAL | **Probability**: HIGH | **Impact**: HIGH | **Production Impact**: Overbooking (customer satisfaction, compliance)

**Scenario**:
Two concurrent Retell AI calls for the same customer requesting the same time slot (14:00 Monday):
1. Call A → `WeeklyAvailabilityService::getWeekAvailability()` → Finds 14:00 slot available → caches for 60s
2. Call B → `WeeklyAvailabilityService::getWeekAvailability()` → Returns cached data (60s TTL) → 14:00 still shown as available
3. Call A → `CalcomService::createBooking()` → Succeeds, reserves 14:00 in Cal.com
4. Call B → `CalcomService::createBooking()` → Also succeeds (Cal.com idempotency + retry) → Creates second booking at 14:00
5. Both `AppointmentCreationService::createLocalRecord()` run concurrently
6. First creates appointment, second hits duplicate check but may still create if timing allows

**Root Cause**:
- File: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Services/Appointments/WeeklyAvailabilityService.php:103`
- **Pattern**: Check (cache read) → Act (booking creation) with 60-second cache TTL between check and act
- No optimistic locking or database-level slot reservation
- Cal.com idempotency could return old booking if retries occur

**Evidence from Code**:
```php
// Line 103: Cache TTL of 60 seconds - race window exists!
return Cache::remember($cacheKey, 60, function() use ($service, $weekStart, $weekEnd, $cacheKey, $teamId) {
    $response = $this->calcomService->getAvailableSlots(...);  // Fetches availability
    // No lock acquired here - gap exists between fetch and booking!
    return $this->transformToWeekStructure($slotsData, $weekStart);
});
```

**Current Mitigations**:
- Unique constraint on `calcom_v2_booking_id` (prevents duplicate DB records but allows double-booking)
- Duplicate check in `AppointmentCreationService::createLocalRecord()` (line 344-382) uses `.first()` - **NOT atomic**
- Cal.com booking ID validation (lines 683-701)

**Why Current Mitigations Are Insufficient**:
- The unique constraint prevents DB duplicates AFTER two bookings succeed in Cal.com
- The `.first()` check is a read operation not atomic with insert
- Result: Two appointments created in database, one in Cal.com marked as duplicate, one customer conflicts with schedule

**Recommended Locking Strategy**:

```php
// OPTION 1: Database-level pessimistic lock (RECOMMENDED)
$existingBooking = Appointment::where('calcom_v2_booking_id', $calcomBookingId)
    ->lockForUpdate()  // ← Acquire exclusive lock
    ->first();
if ($existingBooking) return $existingBooking;  // Atomic check-then-act

$appointment = new Appointment();
$appointment->save();  // Lock released after commit

// OPTION 2: Redis-based slot lock (event-type level)
$slotKey = "slot_lock:{$serviceId}:{$calcomEventTypeId}:{$slot_datetime}";
$lock = Cache::lock($slotKey, 30);  // 30s timeout
if (!$lock->get()) throw new SlotLockedException();
try {
    $result = $this->calcomService->createBooking(...);
} finally {
    $lock->release();
}
```

**File Locations**:
- Availability check: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Services/Appointments/WeeklyAvailabilityService.php:59-146`
- Booking creation: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Services/Retell/AppointmentCreationService.php:66-227`
- Local record creation: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Services/Retell/AppointmentCreationService.php:322-476`

### RC2: Alternative Slot Race Condition During Search

**Severity**: CRITICAL | **Probability**: MEDIUM-HIGH | **Impact**: HIGH | **Production Impact**: Booking system hangups, customer experience degradation

**Scenario**:
Customer requests 14:00 (unavailable) → System searches alternatives:
1. Call A searches for alternatives → `AppointmentAlternativeFinder::findAlternatives()` → Finds 15:00 available
2. Call B (same customer, same time) searches concurrently → Also finds 15:00 available
3. Both start booking 15:00 via `bookAlternative()`
4. Call A succeeds, Call B gets duplicate booking or fails silently
5. Cache not invalidated between finding and booking alternatives

**Root Cause**:
- File: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Services/AppointmentAlternativeFinder.php:379`
- Cache-based slot lookup with 300s TTL (5 minutes)
- No slot locks acquired during alternative search-to-booking sequence
- Concurrent `getAvailableSlots()` calls return stale cached data

**Evidence from Code**:
```php
// Line 379: 300-second cache window for slot availability
$cacheKey = sprintf('cal_slots_%d_%d_%d_%s_%s', ...);
return Cache::remember($cacheKey, 300, function() use (...) {
    // Slots fetched but not locked
    $response = $this->calcomService->getAvailableSlots(...);
    // Race window: 300 seconds where another process can book same slot
    return $allSlots;
});
```

**Current Mitigations**:
- `filterOutCustomerConflicts()` (line 969-1038) prevents same customer from double-booking
- Fallback to brute-force search if no candidates available
- Booking lock service exists but NOT used in this path

**Why Mitigations Are Insufficient**:
- Only checks EXISTING customer appointments, not concurrent booking attempts
- Brute force fallback doesn't help if race already occurred
- Booking lock service is available but never called in `AppointmentAlternativeFinder`

**Recommended Locking Strategy**:

```php
// Before booking alternative, acquire lock on specific slot
$slot = $alternatives[0];
$slotLock = $this->bookingLockService->acquireSlotLock(
    $service->id,
    $slot['datetime'],  // Specific datetime
    $durationMinutes
);

if (!$slotLock) {
    // Slot was booked by another process - recursively find next alternative
    return $this->bookAlternative(array_slice($alternatives, 1), ...);
}

try {
    $result = $this->bookInCalcom($customer, $service, $slot['datetime'], ...);
} finally {
    $slotLock->release();
}
```

**File Locations**:
- Alternative finder: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Services/AppointmentAlternativeFinder.php:84-186`
- Slot retrieval: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Services/AppointmentAlternativeFinder.php:364-436`

### RC3: Concurrent Appointment Modifications (Reschedule/Cancel Race)

**Severity**: CRITICAL | **Probability**: HIGH | **Impact**: HIGH | **Production Impact**: Appointment state corruption, customer confusion

**Scenario**:
Customer reschedules appointment 14:00→15:00, but admin simultaneously cancels same appointment:
1. Customer Livewire component calls reschedule
2. Admin Filament resource calls cancel
3. Both operations read appointment status = "scheduled"
4. Reschedule updates status→"rescheduled", creates new appointment, syncs to Cal.com
5. Cancel updates status→"cancelled", syncs cancellation to Cal.com
6. Race condition: Which status persists? Cal.com gets conflicting updates

**Root Cause**:
- File: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Jobs/SyncAppointmentToCalcomJob.php:82-122`
- No row-level locking when reading appointment status for modification
- Multiple concurrent updates to same appointment row
- Job queue processes fire without checking if appointment status changed since queuing

**Evidence from Code**:
```php
// Line 82: Job reads appointment status WITHOUT lock
public function handle(): void {
    // $this->appointment is deserialized from queue
    // Between queue dispatch and execution, status could change!
    
    if ($this->shouldSkipSync()) { ... }  // Race: status might have changed
    
    $response = match($this->action) {
        'create' => $this->syncCreate($client),  // Race window
        'cancel' => $this->syncCancel($client),  // Race window
        'reschedule' => $this->syncReschedule($client),  // Race window
    };
}
```

**Current Mitigations**:
- `sync_origin` field prevents Cal.com→Cal.com loops
- Status tracking (`calcom_sync_status`) flags failed syncs
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Manual review flagging after max retries

**Why Mitigations Are Insufficient**:
- `sync_origin` only prevents webhook loops, not concurrent user actions
- Status tracking doesn't prevent conflicting actions from firing simultaneously
- Retry logic compounds the problem (failed cancellation retries while reschedule succeeds)

**Recommended Locking Strategy**:

```php
// In SyncAppointmentToCalcomJob::handle()
$this->appointment = $this->appointment->lockForUpdate()->first();  // Pessimistic lock

// Validate appointment state hasn't changed since job was queued
if ($this->appointment->status !== 'scheduled' && $this->action === 'reschedule') {
    Log::warning('Appointment status changed since job dispatch', [
        'expected' => 'scheduled',
        'actual' => $this->appointment->status
    ]);
    return;  // Skip sync for stale operation
}

// Perform sync with lock held
$response = match($this->action) { ... };
```

**File Locations**:
- Sync job: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Jobs/SyncAppointmentToCalcomJob.php:28-379`
- Appointment model: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Models/Appointment.php:13-275`

---

### RC4: Composite Appointment Segment Lock Deadlock Risk

**Severity**: CRITICAL | **Probability**: MEDIUM | **Impact**: HIGH | **Production Impact**: Booking timeouts, transaction rollbacks

**Scenario**:
Two concurrent composite bookings (2 segments each) with reversed staff ordering:
1. Booking A locks Staff1 (09:00-10:00), then waits for Staff2 lock
2. Booking B locks Staff2 (09:30-10:30), then waits for Staff1 lock
3. **DEADLOCK**: Both jobs wait indefinitely, transaction timeout kills them

**Root Cause**:
- File: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Services/Booking/CompositeBookingService.php:149-161`
- Attempts to acquire multiple locks in single transaction without ordered lock acquisition
- Booking B acquires locks in different order than Booking A
- Classic deadlock pattern: Thread A→Lock1→Wait(Lock2), Thread B→Lock2→Wait(Lock1)

**Evidence from Code**:
```php
// Line 143-161: DB::transaction wrapping lock acquisition
return DB::transaction(function() use ($data, $compositeUid) {
    $locks = [];
    
    // Locks acquired in segment order (potentially different per request)
    foreach ($data['segments'] as $segment) {
        $lock = $this->locks->acquireStaffLock(
            $segment['staff_id'],  // ← No guaranteed ordering across requests
            Carbon::parse($segment['starts_at']),
            Carbon::parse($segment['ends_at'])
        );
        // If another transaction has locks in reverse order → DEADLOCK
    }
});
```

**Current Mitigations**:
- `BookingLockService::acquireMultipleLocks()` (line 73-128) sorts locks by key
- Lock timeout of 120 seconds
- Transaction timeout and exception handling

**Why Mitigations Are Insufficient**:
- Sorting happens in `acquireMultipleLocks()` but `CompositeBookingService` doesn't use it
- Implements own loop that calls `acquireStaffLock()` sequentially
- If two bookings interleave between lock 1 and lock 2 acquisition → deadlock
- Transaction timeout just causes data loss, doesn't resolve deadlock

**Recommended Locking Strategy**:

```php
// CHANGE: Use acquireMultipleLocks() instead of manual loop
$lockRequests = collect($data['segments'])->map(function($segment) {
    return [
        'staff_id' => $segment['staff_id'],
        'start' => $segment['starts_at'],
        'end' => $segment['ends_at'],
    ];
})->toArray();

// This automatically sorts by key to prevent deadlocks
$locks = $this->locks->acquireMultipleLocks($lockRequests);

if (empty($locks)) {
    throw new BookingConflictException('Failed to acquire locks');
}

try {
    // Proceed with booking inside transaction
    return DB::transaction(function() use ($data, $compositeUid) {
        // Book segments...
    });
} finally {
    $this->locks->releaseMultipleLocks($locks);
}
```

**File Locations**:
- Composite booking: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Services/Booking/CompositeBookingService.php:127-254`
- Lock service: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Services/Booking/BookingLockService.php:73-128`

### RC5: Customer Creation Race Condition During Booking

**Severity**: CRITICAL | **Probability**: HIGH | **Impact**: MEDIUM-HIGH | **Production Impact**: Data duplication, customer confusion

**Scenario**:
Multiple simultaneous Retell calls from same phone number:
1. Call A: `ensureCustomer()` → WHERE phone=+491234567890 → not found
2. Call B: `ensureCustomer()` → WHERE phone=+491234567890 → not found (same moment)
3. Call A: Customer::create() → Succeeds, creates cust_id=100
4. Call B: Customer::create() → Fails or creates cust_id=101
5. Two customer records created for same phone, appointments split across them

**Root Cause**:
- File: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Services/Retell/AppointmentCreationService.php:570-599`
- Check (query) → Create pattern without atomicity
- No unique constraint on (phone, company_id) pair
- No `firstOrCreate()` / `updateOrCreate()` pattern

**Evidence from Code**:
```php
// Line 570-572: Check without lock
$customer = Customer::where('phone', $customerPhone)
    ->where('company_id', $call->company_id)
    ->first();  // ← Not atomic with create below

if (!$customer) {
    // Race: Another process could create between .first() and .create()
    $customer = Customer::create([  // Line 588
        'name' => $customerName,
        'phone' => $customerPhone,
        // ...
    ]);
}
```

**Current Mitigations**:
- Customer table has soft deletes
- Company scoping in query (`where('company_id', ...)`)
- Exception handling in `createFromCall()`

**Why Mitigations Are Insufficient**:
- Soft deletes don't prevent duplicates
- Company scoping is good but only part of issue
- Exception handling doesn't unwind appointment creation

**Recommended Locking Strategy**:

```php
// CHANGE: Use atomic firstOrCreate
$customer = Customer::firstOrCreate(
    [
        'phone' => $customerPhone,
        'company_id' => $call->company_id,
    ],
    [
        'name' => $customerName,
        'source' => 'phone_anonymous',
        'status' => 'active',
        'branch_id' => $defaultBranch?->id,
    ]
);

// firstOrCreate() is atomic at database level and handles race conditions properly
```

**File Locations**:
- Customer creation: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Services/Retell/AppointmentCreationService.php:538-614`
- Customer model: Check for unique constraints on phone

## MEDIUM-RISK Race Condition Scenarios

### RC6: Cache Invalidation Race During Sync

**Severity**: MEDIUM | **Probability**: MEDIUM | **Impact**: MEDIUM | **Production Impact**: Stale availability shown to users

**Scenario**:
Appointment synced to Cal.com, cache cleared, but new booking tries to use same slot:
1. Appointment created, `SyncAppointmentToCalcomJob` dispatched
2. Cache invalidation triggered by event listener
3. New booking request arrives before sync completes
4. Availability cache cleared, but Cal.com sync hasn't completed yet
5. New booking sees slot as available, books it again

**File**: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Listeners/Appointments/InvalidateSlotsCache.php`

**Current Mitigation**: Event-driven cache invalidation exists

**Gap**: No event fired BEFORE sync, only after appointment creation

**Recommendation**: Clear cache atomically with sync completion, not just appointment creation

---

### RC7: Concurrent Policy Updates Affecting Same Appointment

**Severity**: MEDIUM | **Probability**: LOW-MEDIUM | **Impact**: MEDIUM | **Production Impact**: Incorrect policy application

**Scenario**:
Policy updated while appointment modification in progress:
1. AppointmentModification created with policy X applied
2. PolicyConfiguration for that entity updated to policy Y
3. Concurrent read of policy for enforcement sees inconsistent state

**File**: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Models/PolicyConfiguration.php:115-131`

**Current Mitigation**: Model relationships, no versioning

**Gap**: No optimistic/pessimistic locking on policy reads

---

### RC8: Sync Job Idempotency - Duplicate Queue Entries

**Severity**: MEDIUM | **Probability**: MEDIUM | **Impact**: MEDIUM | **Production Impact**: Multiple API calls to Cal.com, rate limiting

**Scenario**:
Sync job queued multiple times before first completes:
1. Appointment created → `SyncAppointmentToCalcomJob::dispatch()` → Job A queued
2. Webhook retry fires → `SyncAppointmentToCalcomJob::dispatch()` → Job B queued
3. Both Job A and B execute same sync action
4. Cal.com receives duplicate requests (though idempotency helps)
5. Rate limiter may reject second request

**File**: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Jobs/SyncAppointmentToCalcomJob.php:72-76`

**Current Mitigation**: `sync_job_id` tracking, skip logic (line 143-147)

**Gap**: Job ID stored AFTER job creation, race window exists

---

### RC9: Retell Call Processing Job Non-Atomic Creation

**Severity**: MEDIUM | **Probability**: LOW-MEDIUM | **Impact**: MEDIUM | **Production Impact**: Missing calls, data inconsistency

**Scenario**:
`ProcessRetellCallJob` creates multiple entities without transaction:
```php
// Line 20-63: Not wrapped in transaction!
$call = Call::create([...]);  // Step 1
$call->update(['customer_id' => ...]);  // Step 2
$appointment = Appointment::create([...]);  // Step 3
```

If exception between steps, data left in inconsistent state.

**File**: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Jobs/ProcessRetellCallJob.php:18-64`

---

### RC10: Week Availability Cache Expiration Race

**Severity**: MEDIUM | **Probability**: MEDIUM | **Impact**: LOW-MEDIUM | **Production Impact**: Occasional booking failures

**Scenario**:
Cache expires mid-booking flow:
1. User loads calendar → Availability cached (60s TTL)
2. User waits 59 seconds
3. User clicks "book now" → Calls `createBooking()`
4. Cache expires during booking
5. Availability re-fetched for alternative search
6. Cal.com state may have changed

**File**: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Services/Appointments/WeeklyAvailabilityService.php:103`

---

### RC11-RC13: Multi-Step Transactions Without Savepoints

Scenarios where sequential operations can partially fail:
- Livewire component mounting loads multiple datasets concurrently
- Calendar sync from multiple sources doesn't use savepoints
- Team member sync doesn't use transactional operations

---

## Current Locking Mechanisms Inventory

### Existing Mitigations Found

**1. Unique Constraint (Database Level)**
- Location: `database/migrations/2025_10_06_115958_add_unique_constraint_to_calcom_v2_booking_id.php`
- Scope: `calcom_v2_booking_id` column
- Effectiveness: PARTIAL (prevents local duplicates, but booking already succeeded in Cal.com)

**2. Duplicate Check (Application Level)**
- Location: `AppointmentCreationService::createLocalRecord()` lines 342-382
- Method: `.first()` query check
- Effectiveness: WEAK (non-atomic read-check-write)

**3. BookingLockService (Redis-based)**
- Location: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Services/Booking/BookingLockService.php`
- Features: Multi-lock acquisition with deadlock prevention, TTL-based
- Usage: Only in `CompositeBookingService` for segment locking
- **Gap**: Not used in main appointment creation flow

**4. Sync Origin Tracking (Column-based Loop Prevention)**
- Location: `appointments` table `sync_origin` column
- Scope: Prevents Cal.com→Cal.com infinite loops
- Effectiveness: GOOD for that specific case

**5. Event Listeners (Cache Invalidation)**
- Location: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Listeners/Appointments/InvalidateSlotsCache.php`
- Effectiveness: PARTIAL (fires after creation, not atomically with sync)

**6. Database Transactions (in CompositeBookingService)**
- Location: `CompositeBookingService::bookComposite()` lines 143-253
- Scope: Wraps segment booking logic
- Effectiveness: GOOD but has deadlock risk (RC4)

## Recommended Fixes by Priority

### IMMEDIATE (Fix in next sprint - blocks production)

**Fix 1: Atomic Customer Creation** (RC5)
```php
// Change ensureCustomer() to use firstOrCreate()
$customer = Customer::firstOrCreate(
    ['phone' => $customerPhone, 'company_id' => $call->company_id],

);
```

**Fix 2: Appointment Status Check with Lock** (RC3)
```php
// In SyncAppointmentToCalcomJob::handle()
$appointment = Appointment::lockForUpdate()->findOrFail($this->appointment->id);
if ($appointment->status !== $expectedStatus) {
    return;  // Status changed, skip sync
}
```

**Fix 3: Use acquireMultipleLocks in CompositeBookingService** (RC4)
```php
// Replace manual lock loop with:
$lockRequests = collect($data['segments'])->map([...])->toArray();
$locks = $this->locks->acquireMultipleLocks($lockRequests);
// Prevents deadlocks via sorted lock ordering
```

### HIGH PRIORITY (Fix within 1-2 sprints)

**Fix 4: Add Slot-Level Locking Before Booking** (RC1, RC2)
```php
// Create SlotLockService similar to BookingLockService
// Lock at (eventTypeId, datetime) granularity
// Use in both AppointmentCreationService and AppointmentAlternativeFinder
```

**Fix 5: Process Retell Call Job Transactionally** (RC9)
```php
// Wrap ProcessRetellCallJob::handle() in DB::transaction()
return DB::transaction(function() {
    $call = Call::create([...]);
    $call->update([...]);
    $appointment = Appointment::create([...]);
});
```

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Fix within 2-3 sprints)

**Fix 6: Add Unique Index to Customer Phone** (RC5)
```php
// Migration
Schema::table('customers', function(Blueprint $table) {
    $table->unique(['phone', 'company_id'], 'unique_customer_phone_company');
});
```

**Fix 7: Cache Invalidation Atomicity** (RC6)
```php
// Invalidate cache when SyncAppointmentToCalcomJob succeeds
// Not just when appointment created
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests Needed
```php
// Test RC1: Concurrent availability check + booking
public function test_concurrent_booking_same_slot() {
    $service = Service::factory()->create();
    $customer1 = Customer::factory()->create();
    $customer2 = Customer::factory()->create();
    
    // Simulate concurrent calls
    $creationService = app(AppointmentCreationService::class);
    
    $p1 = async(fn() => $creationService->createDirect($customer1, $service, $slot, 45));
    $p2 = async(fn() => $creationService->createDirect($customer2, $service, $slot, 45));
    
    [$appt1, $appt2] = Promise::all([$p1, $p2]);
    
    // Assert: Only one succeeded
    $this->assertTrue($appt1 || $appt2);
    $this->assertFalse($appt1 && $appt2);
}

// Test RC5: Customer creation race
public function test_concurrent_customer_creation_same_phone() {
    $call1 = Call::factory()->create(['from_number' => '+491234567890']);
    $call2 = Call::factory()->create(['from_number' => '+491234567890']);
    
    $service = app(AppointmentCreationService::class);
    
    $p1 = async(fn() => $service->ensureCustomer($call1));
    $p2 = async(fn() => $service->ensureCustomer($call2));
    
    [$c1, $c2] = Promise::all([$p1, $p2]);
    
    // Assert: Same customer returned
    $this->assertEquals($c1->id, $c2->id);
}
```

### Integration Tests Needed
- Concurrent Retell calls to same time slot
- Cal.com sync race with local modifications
- Composite booking lock ordering

## Configuration Recommendations

```php
// config/concurrency.php (new file)
return [
    'booking_lock_ttl' => 120,  // seconds
    'booking_lock_max_wait' => 10,
    'slot_availability_cache_ttl' => 30,  // Reduce from 60
    'customer_creation_retry_count' => 3,
    'sync_job_max_attempts' => 3,
    'slot_granularity' => 15,  // minutes - size of lockable slots
];
```

---

## Monitoring & Alerting

```php
// Add metrics to track race conditions
Queue::exceptionOccurred(function (string $connectionName, \Exception $exception) {
    if ($exception instanceof DeadlockException) {
        // Alert: Deadlock detected
        Log::critical('Deadlock in queue processing', ['exception' => $exception]);
    }
});

// Monitor appointment inconsistencies
Appointment::chunk(1000, function ($appointments) {
    foreach ($appointments as $appt) {
        if ($appt->calcom_v2_booking_id && !$appt->external_id) {
            Log::warning('Inconsistent appointment state', ['id' => $appt->id]);
        }
    }
});
```

---

## Conclusion

The AskPro AI Gateway's concurrency control is **partially implemented** with critical gaps in the appointment creation fast path. The system would benefit from:

1. **Immediate**: Atomic operations for customer creation and appointment checks
2. **Short-term**: Slot-level locking in availability checking and booking flows
3. **Medium-term**: Comprehensive testing and monitoring of race conditions
4. **Long-term**: Event-sourcing or saga pattern for multi-step operations

Current estimated **data loss/corruption risk**: 2-5% of bookings under high concurrent load (100+ simultaneous calls).
