# Cal.com Integration Fix Report
Date: 2025-09-23 08:35:00

## üéØ Executive Summary
Successfully fixed the broken Cal.com integration that was using **fake Event IDs**. The system now uses **real Cal.com API** integration with proper Event Type creation and synchronization.

## üîç Problems Discovered

### 1. **Fake Event IDs in Database**
- Found 5 services with fake sequential integers (1, 2, 3) as Event IDs
- UI was generating fake IDs with pattern `cal_` + uniqid()
- Users were shown false "synced" status

### 2. **Configuration Issue**
- Cal.com API credentials were in `.env` file
- But `config/services.php` was missing Cal.com configuration
- This caused the CalcomService to receive null API keys

### 3. **Broken Integration**
- ServiceResource was generating fake IDs instead of calling API
- Real CalcomService class existed but wasn't being used
- Command line sync was also generating fake IDs

## ‚úÖ Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Configuration Fixed**
```php
// Added to config/services.php
'calcom' => [
    'api_key' => env('CALCOM_API_KEY'),
    'base_url' => env('CALCOM_BASE_URL', 'https://api.cal.com/v1'),
    'event_type_id' => env('CALCOM_EVENT_TYPE_ID'),
    'team_slug' => env('CALCOM_TEAM_SLUG'),
    'webhook_secret' => env('CALCOM_WEBHOOK_SECRET'),
    // ... OAuth settings
],
```

### 2. **Database Cleaned**
- Migration created: `2025_09_23_082842_clean_fake_calcom_event_ids.php`
- Removed all fake Event IDs (sequential integers and cal_ prefix)
- 5 fake Event IDs cleaned from database

### 3. **ServiceResource Fixed**
- Replaced fake ID generation with real CalcomService calls
- Updated sync action to use `$calcomService->createEventType()`
- Updated bulk sync action with proper error handling
- Fixed "Sync All for Company" header action

### 4. **API Verification**
- ‚úÖ Cal.com API Key: `cal_live_e9aa2c4d18e0fd79cf4f8dddb90903da`
- ‚úÖ Base URL: `https://api.cal.com/v1`
- ‚úÖ API Connection: Working (200 OK)
- ‚úÖ Found 11 real event types in Cal.com account

## üìã SuperClaude Commands Created

### `/sc:calcom-verify`
```bash
php -r "require 'vendor/autoload.php'; \$app = require 'bootstrap/app.php'; \$app->make('Illuminate\\Contracts\\Console\\Kernel')->bootstrap(); require 'scripts/sc-calcom-verify.php';"
```

**Features:**
- Configuration status check
- API connectivity test
- Database analysis

## üöÄ How to Use Real Synchronization

### Individual Service Sync
1. Go to Services page in Filament
2. Click the "Sync" button on any service
3. Service will be created in Cal.com with real Event Type ID

### Bulk Sync
1. Select multiple services
2. Choose "Sync Selected" from bulk actions
3. All selected services will be synced with Cal.com

### Company-Wide Sync
1. Click "Sync All for Company" button in header
2. Select a company
3. All unsynced services for that company will be synced

## üîÑ What Happens During Sync

When syncing a service, the system:
1. Calls `CalcomService->createEventType($service)`
2. Sends service data to Cal.com API:
   - Title: Service name
   - Duration: Service duration_minutes
   - Price: Service price in EUR
   - Description: Service description
   - Metadata: service_id, company_id, category
3. Receives real Event Type ID from Cal.com
4. Stores the real ID in `calcom_event_type_id` field

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Real Event Types in Cal.com
The system found these existing event types:
- ID: 2281265 | Testtermin: Physio Website
- ID: 2026300 | Geheimer Termin
- ID: 2031135 | Herren: Waschen, Schneiden, Styling
- ID: 2031368 | Damen: Waschen, Schneiden, Styling
- ID: 2026317 | Testtermine
- ... and 6 more

### API Limits
- Be aware of Cal.com API rate limits
- Bulk sync processes services sequentially to avoid overwhelming API
- Failed syncs are reported in notifications

## üìä Current Status

- **Total Services**: 25
- **Synced with Cal.com**: 0 (cleaned, ready for real sync)
- **API Status**: ‚úÖ Working
- **Configuration**: ‚úÖ Complete

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test Single Service Sync**
   - Try syncing one service first
   - Verify the Event Type appears in Cal.com dashboard
   - Check returned Event Type ID is stored correctly

2. **Gradual Rollout**
   - Sync services by company
   - Monitor for any API errors
   - Verify all Event Types in Cal.com dashboard

3. **Production Readiness**
   - All fake IDs have been removed
   - Real API integration is now active
   - Error handling is in place
   - Notifications show success/failure
