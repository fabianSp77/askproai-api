# Executive Security Summary
**Critical Multi-Tenant Authorization Vulnerabilities - SEC-002 & SEC-003**

---

## 🚨 Critical Findings

**Date:** October 4, 2025
**Classification:** P0 - Critical Security Incident
**Systems Affected:** Laravel Filament Admin Panel
**Business Impact:** HIGH - Cross-tenant data leakage risk

---

## What Happened

We discovered **two critical security vulnerabilities** in our multi-tenant admin panel that could allow Company A to see data counts and potentially access information from Company B.

### Vulnerability 1: Information Disclosure (SEC-002)
- **CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High)
- **Issue:** Navigation badge counts show total records across ALL companies instead of filtering by tenant
- **Example:** Company A sees "15" policies in their navigation, when they should only see "3" (their own)
- **Risk:** Business intelligence leak, competitive disadvantage, GDPR violation

### Vulnerability 2: Authorization Bypass (SEC-003)
- **CVSS Score:** 8.1 (High)
- **Issue:** Widget queries don't properly validate polymorphic relationship ownership
- **Example:** Notification statistics widget could potentially show data from other companies
- **Risk:** Cross-tenant data breach, compliance violation, customer trust damage

---

## Business Impact

### Immediate Risks
- **Data Privacy:** Company A could infer Company B's usage patterns
- **Competitive Intelligence:** Tenant counts and activity levels exposed
- **Compliance:** GDPR Article 5 violation (data minimization)
- **Trust:** Multi-tenant isolation failure damages customer confidence

### Regulatory Exposure
- **GDPR:** Information disclosure without lawful basis (fines up to €20M or 4% revenue)
- **ISO 27001:** Access control gaps (A.9.4 System Access Control)
- **SOC 2:** Logical access segregation failure (CC6.1, CC6.6)

### Affected Users
- **All tenants** using the admin panel navigation
- **Admin/Manager roles** accessing notification analytics widgets
- **Policy management** features across all companies

## Technical Details (For Technical Stakeholders)

### Root Causes
1. **Over-reliance on Global Scopes:** Badge queries used `::count()` which bypasses Eloquent scopes
2. **Complex Polymorphic Logic:** Widget queries used `orWhereHas` patterns creating bypass opportunities
3. **Missing Type Validation:** No whitelist enforcement on polymorphic `configurable_type`
4. **Implicit Authorization:** No explicit company_id filtering in aggregate queries

### Security Fixes
1. **Explicit Company Filtering**
   ```php
   // Before (VULNERABLE)
   PolicyConfiguration::count(); // All companies

   // After (SECURE)
   PolicyConfiguration::where('company_id', $user->company_id)->count(); // Tenant only
   ```

2. **Polymorphic Validation**
   ```php
   // Type whitelist enforcement
   const ALLOWED_TYPES = [Company::class, Branch::class, Service::class, Staff::class];

   // Ownership validation
   whereHasMorph('configurable', ALLOWED_TYPES, function($q, $type) use ($companyId) {
       // Type-specific company filtering
   });
   ```

3. **Defense in Depth**
   - Layer 1: Model-level validation (type whitelist, ownership checks)
   - Layer 2: Query-level filtering (explicit company_id, secure helpers)
   - Layer 3: Policy-level authorization (badge abilities, polymorphic validation)

## Risk Assessment

### Likelihood vs Impact Matrix

|                | **Low Impact** | **Medium Impact** | **High Impact** |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **High Likelihood** | - | SEC-002 (Badge IDOR) ✓ | - |
| **Medium Likelihood** | - | - | SEC-003 (Polymorphic) ✓ |
| **Low Likelihood** | - | - | - |

### Overall Risk Score: **HIGH**

**Justification:**
- Active vulnerabilities in production
