# Cost Hierarchy System Implementation Summary

## Date: 2025-09-27

## Overview
Successfully implemented a three-tier cost hierarchy system for call management with role-based visibility.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Migration**: `2025_09_27_061151_standardize_call_data_consistency.php`
  - Added cost hierarchy columns: `base_cost`, `reseller_cost`, `customer_cost`
  - Added `cost_calculation_method` and `cost_breakdown` fields
  - Added database indices for performance
  - Standardized `duration_sec` and `status` fields

### 2. Cost Calculator Service
- **File**: `app/Services/CostCalculator.php`
- **Features**:
  - Three-tier cost calculation (Base → Reseller → Customer)
  - Role-based cost display logic
  - Support for reseller markup (default 20%)
  - Volume discounts and promotional rates
  - Detailed cost breakdown tracking

### 3. UI Updates

#### CallResource (`app/Filament/Resources/CallResource.php`)
- Dynamic cost column label based on user role
- Role-based cost visibility
- Cost breakdown in description for super admins
- Additional cost columns toggleable for super admins

#### CallStatsOverview Widget (`app/Filament/Widgets/CallStatsOverview.php`)
- Role-based cost aggregation
- German localization
- Performance optimization with caching

#### OngoingCallsWidget (`app/Filament/Widgets/OngoingCallsWidget.php`)
- Live call duration calculation
- German translations
- Professional appearance (removed playful emojis)

### 4. Webhook Integration
- **Files Updated**:
  - `RetellWebhookController.php`: Calculates costs on call_ended event
  - `RetellApiClient.php`: Calculates costs during call sync
- Automatic cost calculation when calls are processed
- Error handling and logging

### 5. Cost Calculation for Existing Data
- **Migration**: `2025_09_27_calculate_costs_for_existing_calls.php`
- Processed 77 out of 79 existing calls
- Calls without duration were skipped

## Cost Hierarchy Structure

```
Base Cost (Our Costs)
├── Retell API cost (€0.10/minute)
├── Infrastructure cost (€0.05/call)
└── Token usage cost (variable)
    ↓
Reseller Cost (What Reseller Pays)
├── Base Cost + 20% markup
└── Configurable per reseller
    ↓
Customer Cost (End Customer Pays)
├── Based on pricing plan
├── Per-minute or per-call rates
└── Included minutes consideration
```

## Role-Based Visibility

| Role | Sees | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Super Admin | All costs | Full visibility of base, reseller, and customer costs |
| Reseller Admin/Owner | Reseller cost | What they pay us + their customers' costs |
| Company Admin/Staff | Customer cost | Only their final cost |

## Testing

Created test command: `php artisan test:cost-hierarchy`
- Validates cost calculation logic
- Tests role-based visibility
- Provides detailed cost breakdown

## Database Results
- 77 calls with calculated base costs
- 77 calls with calculated customer costs
- Cost calculation method tracked (direct/reseller)

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

   - Export with role-appropriate costs
   - Multiple formats (CSV, Excel, PDF)

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Cost trends over time
   - Profitability analysis per customer/reseller
   - Cost optimization recommendations

4. **Bulk Operations**
   - Recalculate costs for selected calls
   - Apply promotional rates retroactively

- Professional appearance maintained (no playful emojis)
- Performance optimized with caching strategies
- System respects existing role structure (Super Admin, reseller_admin, company_admin)
