$recurringService = app(RecurringAppointmentService::class);
$appointments = $recurringService->createRecurringAppointments($appointment, [
    'frequency' => 'weekly',
    'interval' => 1,
    'days_of_week' => ['monday', 'wednesday', 'friday'],
    'occurrences' => 12
]);
```

$syncService = app(CalendarSyncService::class);
$success = $syncService->syncToGoogle($appointment, 'create');
```

### Broadcasting Real-Time Updates
```php
broadcast(new AppointmentUpdated($appointment))->toOthers();
```
