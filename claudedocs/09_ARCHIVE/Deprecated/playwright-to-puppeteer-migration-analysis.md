# Playwright to Puppeteer Migration Analysis
**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Architecture**: ARM64 (aarch64) Linux
**System**: Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)

---

## Executive Summary

üîç **Key Finding**: Playwright DOES support ARM64 Linux with Chromium, and your current configuration is already correct.

However, migrating to Puppeteer MCP is recommended for:
- ‚úÖ Simpler configuration (already installed)
- ‚úÖ Better MCP server stability on ARM64
- ‚úÖ Lighter resource footprint
- ‚úÖ More mature ARM64 ecosystem support

## Migration Recommendation

### Recommended Approach: **Remove Playwright, Keep Puppeteer**

**Rationale**:
1. ‚úÖ Puppeteer already installed and configured correctly
2. ‚úÖ Simpler setup with fewer configuration files
3. ‚úÖ Lighter resource footprint
4. ‚úÖ Adequate for most browser automation needs
5. ‚úÖ Better debugging support (connect to active tab)
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Playwright has more features, but adds complexity

### When to Keep Playwright
Consider keeping Playwright if you need:
- Accessibility snapshots for testing
- Advanced form filling (batch operations)
- Network request monitoring
- File upload automation
- Drag and drop interactions
- Tab management
- Console message capture

### Hybrid Approach
You can keep BOTH:
- Use Puppeteer for simple automation (navigate, click, screenshot)
- Use Playwright for advanced features when needed
- Claude Code will use whichever MCP server has the required tool

---

## Migration Steps

### 1. Backup Current Configuration
```bash
cp /root/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json \
   /root/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json.backup
```

### 2. Remove Playwright MCP Configuration
Edit `/root/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` and remove:
```json
"playwright-mcp": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest", "--config", "/etc/mcp/playwright-arm64.json", "--caps=vision,pdf"],
  "env": {"npm_config_yes": "true"}
},
```

### 3. Verify Puppeteer Configuration
Ensure this remains in the config:
```json
"puppeteer-mcp": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer"],
  "env": {
    "npm_config_yes": "true",
    "PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD": "true",
    "PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH": "/usr/bin/chromium"
  }
}
```

### 4. (Optional) Uninstall Playwright Globally
```bash
# Remove global Playwright installation
npm uninstall -g playwright @playwright/test

# Clean up cached browsers (saves ~2GB)
rm -rf ~/.cache/ms-playwright*
```

### 5. Restart Claude Code
Restart Claude Code to reload MCP server configuration.

### 6. Test Puppeteer MCP
```bash
# Test Puppeteer MCP server
npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer
```

## Tool Mapping Reference

For common browser automation tasks, map Playwright to Puppeteer:

| Task | Playwright MCP | Puppeteer MCP |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| Navigate | `browser_navigate(url)` | `puppeteer_navigate(url)` |
| Screenshot | `browser_take_screenshot(filename)` | `puppeteer_screenshot(name, width, height)` |
| Click | `browser_click(element, ref)` | `puppeteer_click(selector)` |
| Type text | `browser_type(element, ref, text)` | `puppeteer_fill(selector, value)` |
| Hover | `browser_hover(element, ref)` | `puppeteer_hover(selector)` |
| Select | `browser_select_option(element, ref, values)` | `puppeteer_select(selector, value)` |
| Execute JS | `browser_evaluate(function)` | `puppeteer_evaluate(script)` |

**Key Difference**:
- Playwright uses `element` description + `ref` (from accessibility snapshot)
- Puppeteer uses CSS `selector` directly

---

## Post-Migration Validation

### Test Checklist
- [ ] Claude Code starts without MCP errors
- [ ] `puppeteer_navigate` works to open URLs
- [ ] `puppeteer_screenshot` captures page images
- [ ] `puppeteer_click` interacts with elements
- [ ] `puppeteer_evaluate` executes JavaScript
- [ ] System chromium is used (not downloading browsers)

### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: MCP server connection errors
```bash
# Check MCP server logs
journalctl --user -u claude-code -f
```

**Issue**: Chromium not found
```bash
# Verify chromium installation
which chromium
chromium --version

# Reinstall if needed
apt-get update && apt-get install -y chromium
```

**Issue**: Permission errors
```bash
# Ensure chromium is executable
chmod +x /usr/bin/chromium
```

## Conclusion

### Summary
- ‚úÖ Playwright DOES work on ARM64 Linux with Chromium
- ‚úÖ Current Playwright config is already correct for ARM64
- ‚úÖ Puppeteer MCP is simpler, lighter, already configured
- ‚úÖ Migration recommended for simplicity and resource efficiency
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some advanced features lost (accessibility snapshots, network monitoring)

### Recommendation
**Proceed with migration to Puppeteer-only** unless you specifically need Playwright's advanced features.

### Alternative
**Keep both MCP servers** if you need Playwright's advanced capabilities occasionally while defaulting to Puppeteer for simple tasks.
