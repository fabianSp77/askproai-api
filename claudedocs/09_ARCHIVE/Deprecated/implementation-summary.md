```

## üìä System Status

### Working Components
- Admin panel accessible at `/admin`
- All new resources have routes registered
- Communication packages installed and configured
- Health check system operational
- Backup system ready (test mode verified)

### Known Issues (Pre-existing)
- Web server health endpoint returns 404 (needs `/health` route)
- Cal.com API integration warning (expected, needs configuration)

## üöÄ Ready for Use

The following features are now available:

1. **System Management**
   - Run `php artisan app:backup` for full backups
   - Run `php artisan app:health-check` for diagnostics
   - Create admin users with `php artisan user:create-admin`

2. **Admin Panel Features**
   - Customer Notes management at `/admin/customer-notes`
   - Permission management at `/admin/permissions`
   - Bonus Tier configuration at `/admin/balance-bonus-tiers`

3. **Communication Features**
   - Send SMS via `app(SmsService::class)`
   - Generate PDFs via `app(PdfService::class)`
   - Export data via `app(ExportService::class)`

## üìù Configuration Needed

To fully activate communication features, add to `.env`:

```env
# Twilio Configuration
TWILIO_ENABLED=true
TWILIO_SID=your_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=+1234567890
```

## üéØ Next Steps (Future)

1. Create PDF blade templates in `resources/views/pdf/`
2. Configure Twilio credentials for SMS functionality
3. Create remaining Export classes (AppointmentsExport, etc.)
4. Add `/health` route for web server health checks
5. Configure Cal.com API credentials
