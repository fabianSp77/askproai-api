# Week Picker - Executive Summary
**Root Cause Analysis - 2025-10-14**

---

## The Problem in 3 Sentences

The Week Picker slot buttons **bypass Livewire entirely** and try to update the hidden form field using direct DOM manipulation. This fails because `querySelector('input[name=starts_at]')` **cannot find the hidden field** due to component scope isolation. As a result, **slot selection appears to work visually but the form validation fails** because the hidden field is never actually updated.

---

## Why "immer noch dieselbe Problematik"?

Previous fix attempts likely addressed **symptoms** (button styling, event names) but **not the root cause**:

❌ **Root Cause Never Fixed:**
- Slot buttons still use `@click` with direct DOM manipulation
- Hidden field lookup still fails due to wrong scope
- Livewire event system still bypassed

✅ **What Needs To Change:**
- Slot buttons must use `wire:click` to call Livewire method
- Livewire method must dispatch browser events (not Livewire events)
- Wrapper must use `closest('form')` to find parent form

---

## Visual Summary

### Current (BROKEN)
```
User clicks slot button
    ↓
Alpine.js @click handler executes
    ↓
querySelector('input[name=starts_at]') searches wrong scope
    ↓
❌ FAILS - Cannot find hidden field
    ↓
Form validation fails
```

### Fixed (WORKING)
```
User clicks slot button
    ↓
wire:click="selectSlot(...)" calls Livewire method
    ↓
$this->js() dispatches browser event
    ↓
Alpine.js wrapper receives event
    ↓
closest('form').querySelector(...) finds hidden field ✅
    ↓
Hidden field updated
    ↓
Form validation passes ✅
```

## All 5 Issues Found

| # | Issue | Severity | Impact |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Event System Bypassed** | P0 | Livewire method never called |
| 2 | **Hidden Field Not Found** | P0 | Form validation always fails |
| 3 | **Alpine Event Listener Dead** | P0 | Events never reach wrapper |
| 4 | **Dual Implementation Conflict** | P1 | Test button works, slots don't |
| 5 | **Component Scope Isolation** | P0 | querySelector searches wrong scope |

---

## The Fix (4 Changes)

### 1. Slot Buttons: Use Livewire
**Before:**
```blade
@click="querySelector('input[name=starts_at]')..."
```

**After:**
```blade
wire:click="selectSlot('{{ $slot['full_datetime'] }}')"
```

---

### 2. Livewire Method: Dispatch Browser Event
**Before:**
```php
$this->dispatch('slot-selected', [...]);  // ❌ Livewire event
```

**After:**
```php
$this->js(<<<JS
    window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('slot-selected', {
        detail: { datetime: '{$datetime}' }
    }));
JS);  // ✅ Browser event
```

---

### 3. Wrapper: Find Parent Form
**Before:**
```javascript
querySelector('input[name=starts_at]')  // ❌ Wrong scope
```

**After:**
```javascript
$el.closest('form').querySelector('input[name=starts_at]')  // ✅ Correct scope
```

---

### 4. Hidden Field: Add Reactivity
**Before:**
```php
->required()
->reactive()
```

**After:**
```php
->required()
->reactive()
->live(onBlur: false)  // ✅ Immediate updates
```

---

## Evidence

### Proof #1: Test Button Works, Slot Buttons Don't
**Test Button (Line 42):**
```blade
@click="$wire.selectSlot(...)"  ✅ Uses Livewire
```

**Slot Buttons (Line 176):**
```blade
@click="querySelector(...)..."  ❌ Direct DOM manipulation
```

**Conclusion:** Livewire method IS functional, but slot buttons don't call it.

---

### Proof #2: Events Never Reach Alpine.js
**Livewire Dispatch (Line 252):**
```php
$this->dispatch('slot-selected', [...]);  // Server-side event
```

**Alpine Listener (Wrapper Line 16):**
```blade
x-on:slot-selected.window="..."  // Listens on browser window
```

**Conclusion:** Livewire events stay server-side, Alpine.js never receives them.

---

### Proof #3: querySelector Wrong Scope
**Button Location:**
```html
form#filament-form
  └─ div.week-picker-wrapper
      └─ livewire-component (isolated scope)
          └─ button @click="querySelector(...)" ← Searches from HERE
```

**Hidden Field Location:**
```html
form#filament-form
  └─ input[name=starts_at] ← TARGET is here
```

**Conclusion:** Button and hidden field are NOT in same scope tree.

## Impact Analysis

### Current State (Broken)
- ❌ Slot selection visually works (button highlights)
- ❌ Form validation always fails
- ❌ Cannot create appointments via week picker
- ❌ Users forced to use manual datetime picker
- ❌ Poor UX (selected slot doesn't persist)

### After Fix
- ✅ Slot selection works end-to-end
- ✅ Form validation passes
- ✅ Appointments created successfully
- ✅ Week picker is primary booking method
- ✅ Selected slot persists correctly

## Estimated Effort

| Phase | Time | Risk |
|-------|------|------|
| Apply fixes | 30 min | 🟡 Low |
| Test locally | 15 min | 🟢 None |
| Deploy | 5 min | 🟡 Low |
| Verify production | 10 min | 🟢 None |
| **TOTAL** | **~1 hour** | **🟡 Low** |

**Risk Mitigation:** All changes are localized, easily reversible with git checkout.

## Why Previous Fixes Failed

### Attempt 1: "Event System Fix"
**What Changed:** Event name from camelCase to kebab-case
**Why Failed:** Events still Livewire-only, never reached Alpine.js
**Root Cause:** Event dispatch method wrong, not just name

### Attempt 2: "DOM Selector Fix"
**What Changed:** Different querySelector strategies
**Why Failed:** All querySelector approaches fail due to scope isolation
**Root Cause:** Architectural issue, not selector strategy

### Attempt 3: "Alpine.js Binding"
**What Changed:** Various x-data/x-on combinations
**Why Failed:** Events never dispatched to browser window
**Root Cause:** PHP dispatches Livewire events, not browser events

## Key Learnings

### For Developers
1. **Never use `querySelector` in Livewire views** - Use Livewire methods and events
2. **Livewire events ≠ Browser events** - Use `$this->js()` for Alpine.js communication
3. **Test buttons differently than production** - Inconsistency masks bugs
4. **Component isolation is real** - Cannot rely on global DOM access

### For Architecture
1. **Filament + Livewire integration needs care** - ViewFields have isolated scope
2. **Event systems must match** - Server events vs browser events
3. **Wrapper components are bridges** - Must handle scope properly
4. **Hidden fields need explicit reactivity** - `->live()` directive critical

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why does the test button work?
**A:** Test button uses `$wire.selectSlot()` which correctly calls the Livewire method. Slot buttons bypass Livewire entirely.

### Q: Why didn't previous fixes work?
**A:** Previous fixes addressed symptoms (styling, event names) but not the root cause (architectural mismatch between Livewire and Alpine.js).

### Q: Will this break anything else?
**A:** No. Changes are localized to Week Picker component. All changes use Livewire's intended patterns.

### Q: Can we just fix the querySelector instead?
**A:** No. Even if querySelector worked, direct DOM manipulation bypasses Livewire's reactivity system and creates race conditions. Must use Livewire methods.

### Q: Why not use Livewire wire:model instead of Alpine.js?
**A:** Week Picker needs rich interactivity (hover, animations, week navigation) that Alpine.js provides. The fix maintains this while properly integrating with Livewire.
