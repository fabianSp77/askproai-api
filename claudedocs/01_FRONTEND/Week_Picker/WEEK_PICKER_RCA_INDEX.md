## 🎓 Learning Resources

### Understanding Livewire 3 Events
**Document:** `WEEK_PICKER_VISUAL_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md` § "Livewire 3 Event Systems"

**Key Concepts:**
- Livewire events (component-to-component)
- Browser events (component-to-Alpine.js)
- `$this->dispatch()` vs `$this->js()`
- Event naming conventions

### Understanding Component Scope
**Document:** `WEEK_PICKER_VISUAL_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md` § "DOM Structure Analysis"

**Key Concepts:**
- Livewire component isolation
- Alpine.js scope nesting
- QuerySelector search behavior
- `closest()` vs `querySelector()`

### Filament Form Integration
**Document:** `WEEK_PICKER_COMPREHENSIVE_RCA_2025-10-14.md` § "Issue #5"

**Key Concepts:**
- ViewField rendering
- Hidden field wire:model
- Form reactivity triggers
- afterStateUpdated callbacks

---

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls (Avoid These)

### ❌ DON'T: Use querySelector in Livewire views
```blade
@click="document.querySelector('input[name=starts_at]')"
```
**Why:** Component isolation prevents reliable DOM access

### ✅ DO: Use Livewire methods
```blade
wire:click="selectSlot('...')"
```

---

### ❌ DON'T: Dispatch Livewire events for Alpine.js
```php
$this->dispatch('event-name', [...]);
```
**Why:** Livewire events stay server-side, Alpine.js never receives them

### ✅ DO: Use browser events
```php
$this->js("window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('event-name', {...}))");
```

---

### ❌ DON'T: Mix @click and wire:click on same button
```blade
<button @click="..." wire:click="...">
```
**Why:** Creates race conditions and unpredictable behavior

### ✅ DO: Choose one method consistently
```blade
<button wire:click="method()">
```
