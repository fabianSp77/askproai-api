**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: ✅ Successfully completed
**Space freed**: 2.3 GB

## Migration Summary

Successfully migrated from Playwright MCP to Puppeteer MCP on ARM64 Linux system.

### What Was Done

#### 1. Configuration Changes
- ✅ Backed up original config: `/root/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json.backup-20251001-202241`
- ✅ Removed `playwright-mcp` MCP server configuration
- ✅ Retained `puppeteer-mcp` as primary browser automation tool

#### 2. Package Cleanup
- ✅ Uninstalled global packages:
  - `playwright@1.55.0`
  - `@playwright/test@1.55.0`
  - `@playwright/mcp@latest`
- ✅ Removed browser cache: `~/.cache/ms-playwright*` (2.3 GB freed)

#### 3. Retained Packages
- ✅ `puppeteer@24.19.0` (global)
- ✅ `puppeteer-mcp-server@0.7.2` (global)
- ✅ `@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer` (via npx)

## Current MCP Configuration

**File**: `/root/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

### Browser Automation (Puppeteer MCP)
```json
"puppeteer-mcp": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer"],
  "env": {
    "npm_config_yes": "true",
    "PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD": "true",
    "PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH": "/usr/bin/chromium"
  }
}
```

**Key Configuration Details**:
- Uses system Chromium: `/usr/bin/chromium` (v140.0.7339.185)
- Skips downloading Chromium binaries (ARM64 optimized)
- Auto-confirms npm package installations

### Other Active MCP Servers
1. **sequential-thinking** - Complex reasoning support
2. **composio** - Figma integration
3. **browser-use** - Alternative browser automation
4. **vibetest** - Visual testing
5. **screenshot** - Screenshot capture

---

## Available Puppeteer MCP Tools

### Core Navigation
- `puppeteer_navigate(url)` - Navigate to URL
- `puppeteer_connect_active_tab(debugPort, targetUrl)` - Connect to existing Chrome instance

### Interaction
- `puppeteer_click(selector)` - Click elements via CSS selector
- `puppeteer_fill(selector, value)` - Fill input fields
- `puppeteer_select(selector, value)` - Select dropdown options
- `puppeteer_hover(selector)` - Hover over elements

### Utilities
- `puppeteer_screenshot(name, width, height)` - Capture screenshots
- `puppeteer_evaluate(script)` - Execute JavaScript in browser context

---

## Migration from Playwright Tools

If you previously used Playwright MCP tools, here's the mapping:

| Playwright MCP Tool | Puppeteer MCP Equivalent |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| `browser_navigate(url)` | `puppeteer_navigate(url)` |
| `browser_click(element, ref)` | `puppeteer_click(selector)` |
| `browser_type(element, ref, text)` | `puppeteer_fill(selector, text)` |
| `browser_hover(element, ref)` | `puppeteer_hover(selector)` |
| `browser_select_option(...)` | `puppeteer_select(selector, value)` |
| `browser_take_screenshot(...)` | `puppeteer_screenshot(name, width, height)` |
| `browser_evaluate(function)` | `puppeteer_evaluate(script)` |

### Key Differences
1. **Selector Strategy**:
   - Playwright: Uses accessibility snapshots with element descriptions + refs
   - Puppeteer: Uses direct CSS selectors

2. **No Longer Available** (Playwright-specific):
   - Accessibility snapshots
   - Network request monitoring
   - Console message capture
   - Dialog handling
   - File upload automation
   - Drag & drop
   - Tab management
   - Form batch filling

3. **Puppeteer Advantages**:
   - Simpler API
   - Direct CSS selectors (more intuitive)
   - Connect to existing browser instances
   - Better debugging support (port 9222)
   - Lighter resource footprint

## System Verification

### ✅ Environment Status
```
Architecture: aarch64 (ARM64)
Chromium: /usr/bin/chromium v140.0.7339.185 ✅
Puppeteer: v24.19.0 ✅
Puppeteer MCP Server: v0.7.2 ✅
MCP Server: @modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer ✅
```

### ✅ Configuration Files
- Main config: `/root/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` ✅
- Backup: `/root/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json.backup-20251001-202241` ✅
- Playwright config: `/etc/mcp/playwright-arm64.json` (no longer used, can be removed)

### ✅ Disk Space
- **Freed**: 2.3 GB (Playwright cache removed)
- **Current**: Puppeteer uses system Chromium (no cache)

---

## Next Steps

### To Complete Migration
1. **Restart Claude Code** - Reload MCP server configuration
2. **Test Puppeteer MCP** - Try basic navigation and screenshot
3. **(Optional) Remove Playwright config**: `rm /etc/mcp/playwright-arm64.json`

### Testing Checklist
```bash
# Test commands (after Claude Code restart)
# These will be available as MCP tools:
- puppeteer_navigate("https://example.com")
- puppeteer_screenshot("test", 1280, 720)
- puppeteer_click("button.submit")
- puppeteer_evaluate("document.title")
```

### Rollback Instructions (if needed)
If you need to restore Playwright:

```bash
# Restore configuration
cp /root/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json.backup-20251001-202241 \
   /root/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

# Reinstall Playwright
npm install -g playwright @playwright/test
playwright install chromium

# Restart Claude Code
```

### Full Analysis
See comprehensive analysis: `/var/www/api-gateway/claudedocs/playwright-to-puppeteer-migration-analysis.md`

Contains:
- Detailed ARM64 compatibility research
- Performance comparisons
- Tool feature matrix
- Migration decision rationale
- Troubleshooting guide

### Key Findings from Analysis
1. **Playwright DOES support ARM64** with Chromium (Chrome branded version not available)
2. **Puppeteer is simpler** for most browser automation tasks
3. **Both tools perform similarly** on ARM64 architecture
4. **Puppeteer uses less resources** (no browser cache, lighter footprint)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: MCP Server Connection Errors
**Solution**: Restart Claude Code to reload MCP configuration

### Issue: Chromium Not Found
```bash
# Verify installation
which chromium
chromium --version

# Reinstall if needed
apt-get update && apt-get install -y chromium
```

### Issue: Permission Errors
```bash
# Ensure chromium is executable
chmod +x /usr/bin/chromium
```

### Issue: Puppeteer Tools Not Available
**Check**:
1. Claude Code restarted after config change
2. MCP server configuration is valid JSON
3. npx can access `@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer`

```bash
# Test manually
npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer
# Should start and wait for stdio input
```
