**Date**: 2025-10-28 18:45 CET
**Severity**: 🚨 **CRITICAL** - Multiple admin pages broken
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

---

## 🔴 Problem

### Symptom
```
Illuminate\Database\QueryException
SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'price' in 'SELECT'
(Connection: mysql, SQL: select sum(`price`) as aggregate from `appointments` ...)
```

**Impact**:
- Services admin page (500 error)
- Profit Dashboard page (potential 500 error)
- Profit Overview Widget (potential 500 error)
- All pages trying to aggregate appointment revenue

**Pages Affected**:
- `/admin/services` - Completely broken
- `/admin/profit-dashboard` - Revenue calculations broken
- Profit widgets on dashboard

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation

**Schema Analysis**:
```bash
# appointments table DOES NOT have price column
mysql> SHOW COLUMNS FROM appointments LIKE 'price';
Empty set (0.00 sec)

# services table HAS price column
mysql> SHOW COLUMNS FROM services LIKE 'price';
+-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| price | decimal(10,2)| YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
```

### Root Cause
**Code assumes appointments have price column**, but schema shows:
1. **Price is stored in `services` table** - Each service has ONE price
2. **Appointments reference services** - via `service_id` foreign key
3. **Revenue must be calculated** - appointments * service.price (not sum appointments.price)

### Why This Happened
1. **Legacy code pattern** - Old code may have had price column on appointments
2. **Migration missing** - Either never had price column, or was removed without updating code
3. **Model inconsistency** - `Appointment` model had `price` in `$casts` array but column doesn't exist
4. **Eager loading wrong columns** - Multiple places loading `appointments:id,call_id,price`

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Fix ServiceResource Revenue Calculations
**File**: `app/Filament/Resources/ServiceResource.php`

**Changed (2 locations)**:
```php
// ❌ BEFORE: Trying to sum price from appointments (column doesn't exist)
$revenue = $record->appointments()
    ->where('status', 'completed')
    ->sum('price');

// ✅ AFTER: Calculate revenue from service price * completed count
$completedCount = $record->appointments()
    ->where('status', 'completed')
    ->count();
$revenue = $completedCount * ($record->price ?? 0);
```

**Locations**:
- Line 950-954: `appointment_stats` badge calculation
- Line 970-975: Tooltip revenue display

### 2. Fix Call Model Revenue Method
**File**: `app/Models/Call.php`

**Changed**: `getAppointmentRevenue()` method

```php
// ❌ BEFORE: Summing price from appointments
return (int)($this->appointments->sum('price') * 100);

// ✅ AFTER: Calculate from service prices
if ($this->relationLoaded('appointments')) {
    $revenue = $this->appointments
        ->filter(fn($appointment) => $appointment->relationLoaded('service'))
        ->sum(fn($appointment) => $appointment->service->price ?? 0);
    return (int)($revenue * 100);
}

// Fallback with JOIN to services table
return (int)($this->appointments()
    ->join('services', 'appointments.service_id', '=', 'services.id')
    ->where('appointments.status', 'completed')
    ->sum('services.price') * 100);
```

### 3. Fix Profit Dashboard Eager Loading
**File**: `app/Filament/Pages/ProfitDashboard.php`

**Changed (3 locations)**:
```php
// ❌ BEFORE: Trying to load price column from appointments
->with('appointments:id,call_id,price')

// ✅ AFTER: Load service_id and status, then eager load service with price
->with(['appointments:id,call_id,service_id,status', 'appointments.service:id,price'])
```

**Locations**:
- Line 100: Today's stats
- Line 121: Month's stats
- Line 174: Daily chart data

### 4. Fix Profit Overview Widget Eager Loading
**File**: `app/Filament/Widgets/ProfitOverviewWidget.php`

**Changed (4 locations)**:
```php
// ❌ BEFORE
->with('appointments:id,call_id,price')

// ✅ AFTER
->with(['appointments:id,call_id,service_id,status', 'appointments.service:id,price'])
```

**Locations**:
- Line 46: Today's profit calculation
- Line 66: Yesterday comparison
- Line 81: Month stats
- Line 146: Chart data (7-day graph)

### 5. Remove Invalid Cast from Appointment Model
**File**: `app/Models/Appointment.php`

**Changed**: Line 53 in `$casts` array

```php
// ❌ BEFORE: Casting non-existent column
'price' => 'decimal:2',

// ✅ AFTER: Commented out with explanation
// 'price' => 'decimal:2',  // ❌ REMOVED: appointments table has no price column (price comes from service)
```

**Note**: Kept `price` in `$guarded` array (line 32) - this prevents accidental mass assignment even if someone tries to add price data.

## 📊 Summary of Changes

### Files Modified: 5
1. `app/Filament/Resources/ServiceResource.php` - 2 fixes
2. `app/Models/Call.php` - 1 method rewritten
3. `app/Filament/Pages/ProfitDashboard.php` - 3 eager loading fixes
4. `app/Filament/Widgets/ProfitOverviewWidget.php` - 4 eager loading fixes
5. `app/Models/Appointment.php` - 1 cast removed

### Total Code Changes: 11 locations

### Logic Changes:
- **Before**: Attempted to sum `appointments.price` (column doesn't exist)
- **After**: Calculate revenue as `completed_appointments_count * service.price`

### Performance Impact:
- ✅ **No performance regression** - Still using eager loading
- ✅ **May be slightly better** - Loading service prices via relationship instead of non-existent column
- ✅ **N+1 queries prevented** - All relationships properly eager loaded

---

## 🛡️ Prevention

### Database Schema Documentation
**Current Schema**:
```
appointments table:
  - id (primary key)
  - service_id (FK → services.id)
  - customer_id (FK → customers.id)
  - staff_id (FK → staff.id)
  - status (enum: scheduled, completed, cancelled, no_show)
  - starts_at (timestamp)
  - ends_at (timestamp)
  - ❌ NO price column

services table:
  - id (primary key)
  - name (string)
  - price (decimal 10,2) ✅ Price is here
  - duration_minutes (int)
```

### Revenue Calculation Pattern
**Correct pattern for calculating appointment revenue**:

```php
// For a single service's revenue:
$completedCount = Service::find($id)
    ->appointments()
    ->where('status', 'completed')
    ->count();
$revenue = $completedCount * $service->price;

// For a call's revenue (multiple services possible):
$revenue = $call->appointments()
    ->join('services', 'appointments.service_id', '=', 'services.id')
    ->where('appointments.status', 'completed')
    ->sum('services.price');

// With eager loading (optimal):
$call->load(['appointments.service']);
$revenue = $call->appointments->sum(fn($apt) => $apt->service->price ?? 0);
```

### Testing Checklist
Before deploying revenue-related changes:
```bash
# 1. Verify schema
mysql> SHOW COLUMNS FROM appointments;
# Ensure price column does NOT exist

# 2. Test services page
curl -I https://api.askproai.de/admin/services
# Should return 200 (after login redirect)

# 3. Check for appointments.price references
grep -rn "appointments.*price" app/ --include="*.php"
# Should only show service-based calculations

# 4. Verify eager loading
grep -rn "appointments:.*price" app/ --include="*.php"
# Should NOT exist (should be appointments.service:id,price instead)
```

## 📝 Testing & Verification

### Syntax Validation: ✅ ALL PASSED
```bash
php -l app/Filament/Resources/ServiceResource.php
# No syntax errors

php -l app/Models/Call.php
# No syntax errors

php -l app/Filament/Pages/ProfitDashboard.php
# No syntax errors

php -l app/Filament/Widgets/ProfitOverviewWidget.php
# No syntax errors

php artisan tinker --execute="echo 'PHP syntax OK';"
# PHP syntax OK
```

### Cache Cleared: ✅
```bash
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear
```

### Expected Behavior After Fix:
1. ✅ Services page loads without errors
2. ✅ Appointment stats badge shows correct count & revenue
3. ✅ Tooltip shows detailed breakdown (total, completed, cancelled, revenue)
4. ✅ Profit Dashboard displays today/month revenue correctly
5. ✅ Profit Overview Widget shows 7-day profit chart
6. ✅ Call model revenue calculation works with eager loaded data

## 🎯 Key Learnings

1. **Schema-Code Alignment is Critical**
   - Code assumptions must match database schema
   - Regular schema audits prevent these issues

2. **Model $casts Should Match Schema**
   - Having casts for non-existent columns causes silent failures
   - Review model definitions when schema changes

3. **Eager Loading Must Use Correct Columns**
   - `->with('appointments:id,call_id,price')` fails silently if column doesn't exist
   - Always verify column existence before using in select statements

4. **Revenue Calculations Need Joins or Eager Loading**
   - When price is in related table, must JOIN or eager load the relationship
   - Cannot sum a column that doesn't exist

5. **Test Admin Pages After Schema Changes**
   - Admin Resource pages often have complex aggregations
   - Manual testing of all admin pages is necessary after DB changes

## ✅ Verification Steps

If this issue reoccurs, use these steps:

1. **Check for appointments.price references**:
```bash
grep -rn "->sum('price')" app/ --include="*.php" | grep appointments
# Should return nothing after fix
```

2. **Check for price in eager loading**:
```bash
grep -rn "appointments:.*price" app/ --include="*.php"
# Should return nothing (should use appointments.service instead)
```

3. **Verify model casts**:
```bash
grep -n "'price'" app/Models/Appointment.php
# Should only show in $guarded, NOT in $casts
```

4. **Test revenue calculations**:
```php
php artisan tinker
$service = App\Models\Service::with('appointments')->first();
$completed = $service->appointments()->where('status', 'completed')->count();
$revenue = $completed * $service->price;
echo "Revenue: €{$revenue}";
```
