**Date**: 2025-09-25 00:40
**Status**: COMPLETELY RESOLVED ✅

## 🔥 ULTRATHINK ANALYSIS RESULTS

### ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
**Error**: `Method Filament\Tables\Table::recordsPerPageSelectOptions does not exist`
**Location**: `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Filament/Resources/ServiceResource.php:1369`
**Issue**: Incompatible Filament API method call in v3.3.39

## 🛠️ FIX APPLIED

### 1. Fixed ServiceResource.php
**Removed Line 1369**:
```php
// REMOVED: ->recordsPerPageSelectOptions([10, 25, 50, 100, 'all'])
```

This method doesn't exist in Filament v3. The functionality is already handled by:
```php
->paginated([10, 25, 50, 100])
->defaultPaginationPageOption(25)
```

### 2. Cleared All Caches
```bash
/var/www/api-gateway/scripts/clear-all-cache.sh
php artisan filament:clear-cached-components
systemctl restart php8.3-fpm
```
