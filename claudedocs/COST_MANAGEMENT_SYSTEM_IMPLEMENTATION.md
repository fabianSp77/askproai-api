# Cost Management System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive cost management system for tracking and managing external service costs (Cal.com, Retell.ai, Twilio) with automatic currency conversion from USD to EUR.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Structure
- **platform_costs** table: Tracks individual service costs per call/usage
- **monthly_cost_reports** table: Aggregated monthly cost summaries per company
- **currency_exchange_rates** table: Manages USD/EUR/GBP exchange rates
- **calls table extended**: Added fields for external cost tracking (retell_cost_usd, twilio_cost_usd, total_external_cost_eur_cents)

### 2. Models Created
- `PlatformCost`: Manages individual platform cost records
- `MonthlyCostReport`: Handles monthly aggregated reports
- `CurrencyExchangeRate`: Manages exchange rates with caching

### 3. Services
- **ExchangeRateService**:
  - Fetches real-time rates from ECB (European Central Bank)
  - Converts currencies with fallback rates
  - Caches rates for performance

- **PlatformCostService**:
  - Tracks Retell.ai costs ($0.07/minute)
  - Tracks Twilio costs ($0.0085/minute inbound)
  - Tracks Cal.com subscriptions ($15/user/month)
  - Generates monthly reports with profit calculations

### 4. Admin UI (Filament Resources)
- **Platform Costs Management** (`/admin/platform-costs`)
  - View all platform costs
  - Filter by service, date, company
  - Dashboard widget showing current month costs
  - Real-time cost tracking

- **Exchange Rate Management** (`/admin/currency-exchange-rates`)
  - View and manage exchange rates
  - Update rates from external sources
  - Manual rate adjustments
  - Historical rate tracking

### 5. Webhook Integration
Updated `RetellWebhookController` to:
- Automatically track Retell.ai costs when calls end
- Estimate Twilio telephony costs
- Convert USD costs to EUR using current exchange rates
- Store costs in platform_costs table

### 6. Console Commands
- `php artisan costs:test` - Test the system
- `php artisan costs:track-calcom` - Track Cal.com subscription costs
- `php artisan costs:generate-monthly-report` - Generate monthly reports

### 7. Configuration
Created `/config/platform-costs.php` with:
- Service pricing configurations
- Exchange rate settings
- Alert thresholds
- Reporting preferences

## Current Exchange Rates
- USD to EUR: 0.92
- EUR to USD: 1.087
- GBP to EUR: 1.16

## Cost Tracking Flow

1. **Call Ends** → Webhook received
2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Retell: $0.07/minute (estimated or from webhook)
   - Twilio: $0.0085/minute (estimated)
3. **Currency Conversion**: USD → EUR using current rates
4. **Storage**:
   - Individual costs in `platform_costs` table
   - Call costs in `calls` table fields
5. **Reporting**: Monthly aggregation and profit calculation

## Accessing the System

### Admin Pages
- Platform Costs: https://api.askproai.de/admin/platform-costs
- Exchange Rates: https://api.askproai.de/admin/currency-exchange-rates

### Testing
Run `php artisan costs:test` to verify:
- ✅ Database tables exist
- ✅ Exchange rates are loaded
- ✅ Currency conversion works
- ✅ Configuration is correct

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor First Calls**: When new calls come in, costs will be automatically tracked
2. **Monthly Reports**: Run monthly report generation on the 1st of each month
3. **Cal.com Tracking**: Set up monthly job to track Cal.com subscription costs
4. **Cost Alerts**: Configure alert thresholds in .env file

## Configuration Variables (for .env)
```env
# Retell.ai Costs
RETELL_COST_PER_MINUTE_USD=0.07

# Twilio Costs
TWILIO_INBOUND_COST_USD=0.0085
TWILIO_OUTBOUND_COST_USD=0.013

# Cal.com Costs
CALCOM_USER_COST_USD=15

# Exchange Rates (fallbacks)
DEFAULT_USD_TO_EUR_RATE=0.92
DEFAULT_GBP_TO_EUR_RATE=1.16

# Alerts (optional)
COST_ALERTS_ENABLED=true
DAILY_COST_ALERT_EUR=100
MONTHLY_COST_ALERT_EUR=2000
```

## Important Notes

1. **Automatic Tracking**: External costs are now automatically tracked when calls end via webhook
2. **Currency Conversion**: All costs are converted to EUR for consistent reporting
3. **Profit Calculation**: System calculates profit margins automatically
4. **Exchange Rate Updates**: Rates can be updated manually or via ECB API

## Troubleshooting

If costs are not being tracked:
1. Check webhook logs for errors
2. Verify exchange rates exist: `php artisan costs:test`
3. Check call duration is > 0
4. Ensure webhook is receiving cost data from Retell

## Security Considerations
- Exchange rates are cached for 1 hour to reduce API calls
- All costs stored in cents to avoid floating point issues
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
- Sensitive cost data is only visible to admin users
