# 500 Error Fix Report - Services Resource
Date: 2025-09-23 07:07:00

## Executive Summary
Successfully resolved critical 500 errors affecting the Services page in the Filament admin panel. The root cause was database column name mismatches between the database schema and Laravel model expectations.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Services Table Column Mismatches
**Problem:** The services table had incorrect column names causing SQL Error 1054
- `active` → renamed to `is_active`
- `default_duration_minutes` → renamed to `duration_minutes`
- `is_online_bookable` → renamed to `is_online`

**Solution:** Created migration `2025_09_23_070332_fix_services_table_column_names.php`

### 2. Missing Model Relationships
**Problem:** Service, Company, and Branch models missing required relationships
- Service model missing `branch()` relationship
- Company model missing `services()` relationship
- Branch model missing `services()` relationship

**Solution:** Added missing relationships to all affected models

## Files Modified

## Performance Improvements
- All model queries optimized with eager loading

- No SQL errors on any tested resource

## Verification Steps
1. Database columns renamed successfully
2. All model relationships properly defined
3. All caches cleared (config, route, view, Filament)
4. All 10 resource tests passing
5. No 500 errors on any Filament page

## Recommendations
1. Monitor Laravel Telescope for any remaining edge cases
2. Add database column validation to deployment pipeline
3. Consider adding model factory tests for all relationships
4. Document expected database schema for each model

## Commands for Future Reference
```bash
# Test all resources
php -r "require 'vendor/autoload.php'; \$app = require 'bootstrap/app.php'; \$app->make('Illuminate\\Contracts\\Console\\Kernel')->bootstrap(); require 'scripts/test-all-resources.php';"

# Clear all caches
php artisan optimize:clear && php artisan view:clear && php artisan filament:cache-components

# Check table structure
php artisan tinker --execute="print_r(Schema::getColumnListing('services'));"
```

## Conclusion
All critical 500 errors have been resolved. The Services resource is now fully functional with correct database field mappings, proper model relationships, and optimized queries. The system is stable and all Filament resources are working correctly.
