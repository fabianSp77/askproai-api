## üîÑ Complete System Flow

### Flow 1: Phone Booking (Retell AI)
```
Customer calls ‚Üí Retell AI creates appointment
‚Üí AppointmentCreationService sets sync_origin='retell'
‚Üí AppointmentBooked event fired
‚Üí SyncToCalcomOnBooked listener checks origin (not 'calcom')
‚Üí Dispatches SyncAppointmentToCalcomJob('create')
‚Üí Job creates booking in Cal.com
‚Üí calcom_v2_booking_id stored
‚Üí calcom_sync_status='synced'
‚Üí ‚úÖ Slot now unavailable in Cal.com
```

### Flow 2: Admin UI Creation
```

‚Üí CreateAppointment page sets sync_origin='admin'
‚Üí AppointmentBooked event fired via afterCreate() hook
‚Üí SyncToCalcomOnBooked listener dispatches job
‚Üí Job creates booking in Cal.com
‚Üí ‚úÖ Slot now unavailable in Cal.com
```

### Flow 3: Admin UI Cancellation
```
Admin clicks "Stornieren" button
‚Üí Cancel action updates status, sets sync_origin='admin'
‚Üí AppointmentCancelled event fired
‚Üí SyncToCalcomOnCancelled listener dispatches job
‚Üí Job cancels booking in Cal.com
‚Üí ‚úÖ Slot now available in Cal.com
```

### Flow 4: Admin UI Reschedule
```
Admin clicks "Verschieben" button, enters new time
‚Üí Reschedule action updates times, sets sync_origin='admin'
‚Üí AppointmentRescheduled event fired with old/new times
‚Üí SyncToCalcomOnRescheduled listener dispatches job

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites

```bash
# 1. Check queue workers running
ps aux | grep "queue:work"
# OR
ps aux | grep "horizon"

# 2. Check database migrations applied
mysql askproai_db -e "SELECT migration FROM migrations WHERE migration LIKE '%sync%' ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;"

# Expected output:
# - 2025_10_13_160319_add_sync_orchestration_to_appointments
# - 2025_10_11_000000_add_calcom_sync_tracking_to_appointments

# 3. Verify sync columns exist
mysql askproai_db -e "DESCRIBE appointments" | grep -E "sync_origin|calcom_sync_status"

# Expected columns:
# - sync_origin
# - sync_initiated_at
# - sync_job_id
# - calcom_sync_status
# - last_sync_attempt_at
# - sync_attempt_count
# - sync_error_message
# - sync_error_code
# - sync_verified_at
# - requires_manual_review
# - manual_review_flagged_at
```

---

### Step 2: Clear Caches

```bash
# Clear application cache
php artisan cache:clear

# Clear config cache
php artisan config:clear

# Clear route cache
php artisan route:clear

# Clear view cache
php artisan view:clear

# Rebuild optimizations
php artisan optimize
```

---

### Step 3: Restart Queue Workers

```bash
# If using Laravel Horizon
php artisan horizon:terminate
# Supervisor will auto-restart

# If using queue:work
sudo supervisorctl restart laravel-worker:*

# Verify workers restarted
php artisan queue:work --once
# Should complete successfully
```

---

### Step 4: Run Test Suite

```bash
# Run sync job tests
php artisan test --filter=SyncAppointmentToCalcomJobTest

# Run security tests
php artisan test --filter=CalcomMultiTenantSecurityTest

# Expected results:
# - At least 3 core tests passing (loop prevention, retry config, job tracking)
# - Security tests should have 2+ passing
```

---

### Step 5: Monitor Logs

```bash
# Watch calcom logs in real-time
tail -f storage/logs/calcom.log

# Watch for these patterns:
# ‚úÖ "AppointmentBooked event received"
# ‚úÖ "Dispatching Cal.com sync job"
# ‚úÖ "Cal.com sync successful"
# ‚ö†Ô∏è "Skipping Cal.com sync (loop prevention)"
# ‚ùå "Cal.com sync failed"
```

---

### Step 6: Execute Production Tests

**Run tests in this order** (see Test 1-7 above):

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Test 1: Loop Prevention** (CRITICAL - Must pass first)
2. Test 2: Phone Booking Sync
3. Test 3: Admin UI Creation Sync
4. Test 4: Admin UI Cancellation Sync
5. Test 5: Admin UI Reschedule Sync
6. Test 6: Bulk Cancellation Sync
7. Test 7: Error Handling

---

### Step 7: Monitor Manual Review Queue (First 24 Hours)

```bash
# Check manual review queue every hour
mysql askproai_db -e "SELECT COUNT(*) as flagged_count FROM appointments WHERE requires_manual_review=1;"

# If count > 0, investigate:
mysql askproai_db -e "SELECT id, sync_origin, sync_error_code, sync_error_message, manual_review_flagged_at FROM appointments WHERE requires_manual_review=1 ORDER BY manual_review_flagged_at DESC LIMIT 10;"

# Check common error patterns:
mysql askproai_db -e "SELECT sync_error_code, COUNT(*) as count FROM appointments WHERE requires_manual_review=1 GROUP BY sync_error_code ORDER BY count DESC;"
```

---

## üìä Monitoring Queries

### Sync Success Rate (Last 24 Hours)

```sql
SELECT
  calcom_sync_status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage
FROM appointments
WHERE created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
  AND sync_origin IN ('retell', 'admin', 'api', 'system')
GROUP BY calcom_sync_status
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

**Target**: >95% synced, <5% pending/failed

---

### Average Sync Latency

```sql
SELECT
  AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, sync_initiated_at, sync_verified_at)) as avg_seconds,
  MAX(TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, sync_initiated_at, sync_verified_at)) as max_seconds,
  MIN(TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, sync_initiated_at, sync_verified_at)) as min_seconds
FROM appointments
WHERE sync_verified_at IS NOT NULL
  AND sync_initiated_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR);
```

**Target**: <10 seconds average, <30 seconds max

---

### Failed Jobs Requiring Manual Review

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  sync_origin,
  sync_error_code,
  sync_error_message,
  sync_attempt_count,
  manual_review_flagged_at,
  TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, manual_review_flagged_at, NOW()) as hours_since_flagged
FROM appointments
WHERE requires_manual_review = 1
ORDER BY manual_review_flagged_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Target**: 0 flagged appointments in steady state

---

### Origin Distribution (Verify all sources syncing)

```sql
SELECT
  sync_origin,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN calcom_sync_status = 'synced' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as synced_count,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN calcom_sync_status = 'synced' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate
FROM appointments
WHERE created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
  AND sync_origin IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY sync_origin
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

**Expected**: All origins (retell, admin, calcom) should show high success rates

---

## üö® Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue 1: Jobs Not Processing

**Symptoms**: `calcom_sync_status` stays 'pending', no sync jobs in logs

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check queue workers
ps aux | grep "queue:work\|horizon"

# Check failed jobs table
mysql askproai_db -e "SELECT * FROM failed_jobs ORDER BY failed_at DESC LIMIT 5;"

# Check Laravel logs
tail -50 storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -i error
```

**Fix**:
```bash
# Restart queue workers
sudo supervisorctl restart laravel-worker:*
# OR
php artisan horizon:terminate

# Retry failed jobs
php artisan queue:retry all
```

---

### Issue 2: Loop Prevention Not Working

**Symptoms**: Duplicate bookings appear in Cal.com after webhook

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check if sync_origin is being set correctly
mysql askproai_db -e "SELECT id, sync_origin, calcom_booking_id FROM appointments WHERE calcom_booking_id IS NOT NULL ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10;"

# Check webhook logs
tail -100 storage/logs/calcom.log | grep "handleBookingCreated"
```

**Fix**: Verify CalcomWebhookController sets `sync_origin = 'calcom'` (line 260)

---

### Issue 3: High Manual Review Queue

**Symptoms**: Many appointments flagged for manual review

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check error patterns
mysql askproai_db -e "SELECT sync_error_code, sync_error_message, COUNT(*) FROM appointments WHERE requires_manual_review=1 GROUP BY sync_error_code, sync_error_message;"

# Common causes:
# - HTTP_401: Invalid API key
# - HTTP_404: Invalid event_type_id
# - HTTP_422: Invalid booking data (dates, etc.)
# - Connection timeout: Network issues
```

**Fix**: Based on error code pattern

---

### Issue 4: Admin UI Events Not Firing

**Symptoms**: Admin UI actions don't sync to Cal.com

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check if events are being fired
tail -100 storage/logs/calcom.log | grep "event received"

# Check if sync_origin is set
mysql askproai_db -e "SELECT id, sync_origin FROM appointments WHERE created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR) ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

**Fix**: Verify event firing in:
- `app/Filament/Resources/AppointmentResource.php` (actions)
- `app/Filament/Resources/AppointmentResource/Pages/CreateAppointment.php`
- `app/Filament/Resources/AppointmentResource/Pages/EditAppointment.php`

---

## üìù Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise, rollback with:

```bash
# 1. Stop dispatching new sync jobs (temporary)
# Comment out event listeners in EventServiceProvider:
# - SyncToCalcomOnBooked::class
# - SyncToCalcomOnCancelled::class
# - SyncToCalcomOnRescheduled::class

# 2. Clear pending jobs
php artisan queue:flush

# 3. Restart queue workers
sudo supervisorctl restart laravel-worker:*

# 4. Monitor for stabilization

# 5. If needed, rollback migrations (data preserved)
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=2
```

**Note**: Rollback does NOT delete data - only removes sync columns and stops new syncs
