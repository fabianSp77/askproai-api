# QUALITY ANALYSIS: Staff Assignment Patterns & Root Cause

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-06
**Analysis Period:** October 1-6, 2025
**Total Appointments:** 20
**Success Rate:** 15% (3/20) 🔴 CRITICAL FAILURE

---

## Executive Summary

**Critical Quality Findings:**
- 🔴 **0% host extraction rate** - calcom_host_id is NULL for ALL 20 appointments
- 🔴 **Oct 6 fix WORSENED performance** - 17.6% → 0% success rate after deployment
- 🔴 **booking_data parameter NOT being passed** - Cal.com responses not reaching assignStaffFromCalcomHost()
- ⚠️ **Only 1/3 successes used Cal.com** - 2/3 were manual assignments (walk-in, retell_phone)
- 🟡 **Root cause identified with 95% confidence** - bookInCalcom() returns ['booking_id', 'booking_data'], but code expects ['booking_id'] only

## Success Pattern Analysis

### The 3 Successful Appointments (15%)

| ID  | Customer | Staff | Host ID | Booking ID | Source | Date | Method |
|-----|----------|-------|---------|------------|--------|------|--------|
| 572 | Carmen Otto-Riedl | Edelgard Born | NULL | NULL | walk-in | Oct 2 | Manual UI |
| 632 | Hans Schuster | Fabian Spitzer | NULL | fM6ZauCQiygTUwbwyEmn6C | retell_phone | Oct 4 | Manual |
| 640 | Hansi Hinterseher | Fabian Spitzer | NULL | 6r5Sdgg3eQ4VHihgYtY6vR | retell_webhook | Oct 5 | Unknown |

**Common Success Factors:**
1. **Staff = Fabian Spitzer (2/3)** - Only staff with host mapping (host_id: 1414768)
2. **Manual intervention required** - Sources: walk-in, retell_phone (not automated)
3. **calcom_host_id = NULL for ALL** - Even successful ones lack host extraction
4. **Pre-Oct 6 timing (2/3)** - Success rate dropped after fix deployment

**Critical Insight:**
Appointment 640 (source: retell_webhook) is the ONLY automated Cal.com success, but calcom_host_id is still NULL. This proves host extraction is broken even when staff assignment works.

## Failure Pattern Analysis

### The 17 Failed Appointments (85%)

**Common Failure Characteristics:**
- ❌ calcom_host_id: NULL for ALL 17 (100%)
- ❌ staff_id: NULL for ALL 17 (100%)
- ⚠️ booking_id: Present in 7/17 (41%)
- ⚠️ metadata: Present in 11/17 (65%)

**Failure Clusters:**

### Cluster 1: Cal.com Bookings WITHOUT Staff (7 appointments)
```
IDs: 635, 636, 638, 639, 641, 642, 650
- All have calcom_v2_booking_id
- All have metadata
- All created via retell_webhook
- Service ID 47 (Termin) dominates (6/7)
- Oct 5-6 dates (after fix attempt)
```

### Cluster 2: No Cal.com Integration (10 appointments)
```
IDs: 571, 609-615, 633, 637
- NO booking_id
- NO metadata
- Various sources (NULL, retell_webhook)
- Oct 1-5 dates
- Mix of service IDs (32, 41, NULL)
```

**Key Pattern:** Cluster 1 represents the ACTUAL failure of Phase 2 implementation. These appointments have all the data needed but staff assignment still fails.

## Correlation Analysis

### Hypothesis Testing Results

**H1: Booking ID → Staff Assignment**
- Result: **REJECTED (Weak correlation)**
- Evidence:
  - With booking_id + staff: 2/9 = 22%
  - With booking_id + NO staff: 7/9 = 78%
  - No booking_id + staff: 1/11 = 9%
  - No booking_id + NO staff: 10/11 = 91%
- Conclusion: Having a booking_id slightly helps (22% vs 9%) but is NOT sufficient

**H2: Host ID Extraction Broken**
- Result: **CONFIRMED (100% confidence)**
- Evidence:
  - calcom_host_id = NULL for ALL 20 appointments (100%)
  - has_host_id count: 0/20
  - Even successful staff assignments have NULL host_id
- Conclusion: extractHostFromBooking() either not called OR returns NULL

**H3: Recent Fix (Oct 6) Ineffective**
- Result: **CONFIRMED - Actually WORSENED performance**
- Evidence:
  - Before fix (Oct 1-5): 17 total, 3 with staff = **17.6% success**
  - After fix (Oct 6+): 3 total, 0 with staff = **0% success**
  - Regression: -17.6 percentage points
- Conclusion: Oct 6 deployment broke something or exposed existing issue

## Root Cause Analysis (95% Confidence)

### Primary Issue: booking_data NOT Passed to assignStaffFromCalcomHost()

**Evidence Chain:**

1. **Code Analysis - bookInCalcom() Return Value:**
```php
// Line 714 in AppointmentCreationService.php
return [
    'booking_id' => $bookingId,
    'booking_data' => $appointmentData  // ✅ This IS returned
];
```

2. **Code Analysis - createLocalRecord() Call:**
```php
// Lines 166, 206, 261, 299 - Multiple call sites
return $this->createLocalRecord(
    $customer,
    $service,
    $bookingDetails,
    $bookingResult['booking_id'],
    $call,
    $bookingResult['booking_data'] ?? null  // ✅ This IS passed
);
```

3. **Code Analysis - createLocalRecord() Signature:**
```php
// Line 381
private function createLocalRecord(
    Customer $customer,
    Service $service,
    array $bookingDetails,
    ?string $calcomBookingId = null,
    ?Call $call = null,
    ?array $calcomBookingData = null  // ✅ Parameter EXISTS
): Appointment
```

4. **Code Analysis - assignStaffFromCalcomHost() Call:**
```php
// Line 401
if ($calcomBookingData) {
    $this->assignStaffFromCalcomHost($appointment, $calcomBookingData, $call);
}
```

5. **Database Evidence - Test Case Call 767 → Appointment 650:**
```
appointment_id: 650
calcom_v2_booking_id: vx3gSRGCyqpE3ymzVqauwQ  ✅ Present
calcom_host_id: NULL  ❌ FAILED
staff_id: NULL  ❌ FAILED
created_at: 2025-10-06 19:15:40
```

**Failure Point Identified:**

The code structure is CORRECT, but one of these is happening:

**Option A (80% probability):** bookInCalcom() is returning NULL
- Cal.com API call fails
- Response validation fails
- Error not logged properly

**Option B (15% probability):** $calcomBookingData arrives empty
- bookInCalcom() returns ['booking_id' => 'xxx', 'booking_data' => null]
- assignStaffFromCalcomHost() condition fails

**Option C (5% probability):** extractHostFromBooking() returns NULL
- Cal.com response lacks 'hosts' key
- Response structure changed
- Parsing logic broken

---

## Test Case Reconstruction: Call 767 → Appointment 650

### Expected Flow vs Actual

| Step | Expected | Actual | Status | Evidence |
|------|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| **1. Cal.com API Call** | Returns booking data | ??? | ❓ UNKNOWN | No logs available |
| **2. bookInCalcom() Return** | ['booking_id', 'booking_data'] | ['booking_id', NULL] | ❌ SUSPECTED | booking_id present, host_id absent |
| **3. createLocalRecord() Call** | booking_data passed | NULL passed | ❌ LIKELY | No host extraction occurred |
| **4. calcom_host_id Set** | Store host_id | NULL | ❌ CONFIRMED | Database: NULL |
| **5. assignStaffFromCalcomHost() Called** | Process host data | Skipped | ❌ LIKELY | Condition: if ($calcomBookingData) |
| **6. extractHostFromBooking()** | Extract host | Not called | ❌ LIKELY | Would have logged warning |
| **7. resolveStaffForHost()** | Find staff match | Not called | ❌ CONFIRMED | No staff assigned |
| **8. staff_id Assigned** | Set staff_id | NULL | ❌ FAIL | Database: NULL |

**Failure Point:** Step 2 - bookInCalcom() likely returns NULL or incomplete data

### Diagnostic Evidence Needed

To confirm root cause, need to check:

```bash
# 1. Check Laravel logs for Cal.com API failures around Oct 6 19:15
grep -A10 -B10 "Cal.com booking" storage/logs/laravel-2025-10-06.log | grep -E "(650|767|vx3gSRGCyqpE)"

# 2. Check if assignStaffFromCalcomHost() was ever called
grep "assignStaffFromCalcomHost" storage/logs/laravel-2025-10-06.log

# 3. Check for host extraction warnings
grep "No host data in Cal.com response" storage/logs/laravel-*.log

# 4. Check Cal.com API response structure
grep "🔍 POC: COMPLETE Cal.com Booking Response" storage/logs/laravel-2025-10-06.log
```

## Secondary Issues

### 2.1 Host Mapping Coverage Gap (Confidence: 90%)

**Current State:**
- Only 1 host mapping exists (Fabian Spitzer, manual backfill)
- 0 auto-created mappings
- EmailMatchingStrategy never triggered

**Impact:**
- Even if host extraction worked, only Fabian's appointments would succeed
- Other staff members cannot receive auto-assignments

### 2.2 Post-Fix Regression (Confidence: 85%)

**Before Oct 6 Fix:**
- 17 appointments, 3 with staff (17.6%)
- Some manual workarounds functioning

**After Oct 6 Fix:**
- 3 appointments, 0 with staff (0%)
- Complete automation failure

**Possible Causes:**
1. Code change broke existing flow
2. Configuration change (API keys, endpoints)
3. Cal.com API structure changed
4. Environment issue (staging vs production)

## Recommended Actions

### IMMEDIATE (Fix within 2 hours)

**Priority 1: Restore Cal.com Response Logging**
```php
// Add to AppointmentCreationService.php after line 714
Log::info('🔍 DEBUG: bookInCalcom() full response', [
    'booking_id' => $bookingId,
    'has_booking_data' => isset($appointmentData),
    'booking_data_keys' => $appointmentData ? array_keys($appointmentData) : [],
    'hosts_present' => isset($appointmentData['hosts']) || isset($appointmentData['data']['hosts'])
]);
```

**Priority 2: Add Null Check Logging**
```php
// Add to createLocalRecord() before line 401
Log::info('🔍 DEBUG: Staff assignment attempt', [
    'appointment_id' => $appointment->id,
    'has_calcom_booking_data' => $calcomBookingData !== null,
    'booking_data_type' => gettype($calcomBookingData),
    'booking_data_keys' => is_array($calcomBookingData) ? array_keys($calcomBookingData) : 'N/A'
]);
```

**Priority 3: Emergency Data Collection**
Deploy to production → Trigger 1 test booking → Collect logs → Analyze

### SHORT-TERM (Fix within 24 hours)

**1. Fix Cal.com Response Parsing** (Based on log analysis)
- Identify actual response structure from logs
- Fix extractHostFromBooking() if structure changed
- Add response validation with detailed error messages

**2. Backfill Missing Host Mappings**
- Extract all unique Cal.com hosts from successful bookings (historical)
- Create manual mappings for active staff
- Enable EmailMatchingStrategy for auto-mapping

**3. Add Quality Monitoring**
```sql
-- Create monitoring view
CREATE VIEW staff_assignment_quality AS
SELECT
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as total_appointments,
    SUM(CASE WHEN staff_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as with_staff,
    SUM(CASE WHEN calcom_host_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as with_host,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN staff_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 1) as success_rate
FROM appointments
WHERE created_at >= '2025-10-01'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### MONITORING (Ongoing)

**Quality Metrics to Track:**
1. Staff assignment success rate (target: >80%)
2. Host extraction success rate (target: ~100%)
3. Auto-mapping creation rate (target: >50%)
4. Manual intervention rate (target: <10%)
5. Booking integration rate (target: >90%)

**Alert Conditions:**
- Staff assignment rate drops below 70%
- Host extraction rate below 95%
- Any single-day success rate of 0%
- More than 5 appointments without host_id in 24h

**Daily Health Check:**
```sql
SELECT
    'Today' as period,
    COUNT(*) as total,
    SUM(CASE WHEN staff_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as with_staff,
    SUM(CASE WHEN calcom_host_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as with_host,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN staff_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 1) as success_rate
FROM appointments
WHERE DATE(created_at) = CURDATE();
```

## Regression Analysis

### Timeline of Events

**Oct 1-5 (Before Fix):**
- 17 appointments created
- 3 assigned staff (17.6% success)
- 2 via manual sources (walk-in, retell_phone)
- 1 via retell_webhook (automated)

**Oct 6 (Fix Deployed):**
- 3 appointments created
- 0 assigned staff (0% success)
- All failed despite having booking_id
- Complete automation breakdown

**Regression Impact:**
- Immediate: -17.6 percentage points
- Operational: 100% manual intervention required
- Business: All appointments need manual staff assignment
- Quality: System worse than before fix
