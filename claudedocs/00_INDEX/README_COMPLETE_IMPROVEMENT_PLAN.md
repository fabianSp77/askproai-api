## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES BEING FIXED

### Issue 1: Schema Mismatch (BLOCKER)
```
Current: INSERT with non-existent columns 'created_by'
Fix: Phase 1 (TODAY) - Remove phantom columns
Impact: 100% appointment creation failure → SUCCESS
```

### Issue 2: Data Inconsistency (CRITICAL)
```
Current: Cal.com booking exists, local record missing
Fix: Phase 2 - Transactional booking + reconciliation
Impact: Orphaned bookings + customer confusion → ZERO ORPHANS
```

### Issue 3: Performance (HIGH)
```
Current: 144 seconds per booking (100s for name verification)
Fix: Phase 4 - Agent prompt optimization + caching
Impact: 144s → 42s (3.4x faster!)
```

### Issue 4: No Resilience (HIGH)
```
Current: Cal.com down → entire system down
Fix: Phase 3 - Circuit breaker + retry logic
Impact: System outage → Graceful degradation
```

### Issue 5: Weak Testing (MEDIUM)
```
Current: No tests for RCA issues
Fix: Phase 6 - 100% RCA coverage + CI/CD
Impact: Regression of bugs → Zero regressions
```
