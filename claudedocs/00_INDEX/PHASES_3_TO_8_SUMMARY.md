### Key Deliverables
```
✅ Domain-specific exceptions (AppointmentCreationException, etc.)
✅ Circuit breaker for Cal.com API (5 failures/60s → open)
✅ Exponential backoff retry (1s, 2s, 4s)
✅ Structured logging with correlation IDs
✅ Error tracking + alerting
```

### Files to Create
```

    ],
];
```

### Test Coverage

## 🟠 PHASE 4: PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS (Week 4-5)

### Goal
Reduce booking time from 144s → 42s (77% improvement)

### Key Optimizations

#### 4.1 N+1 Query Elimination
```
Target: -12ms
Tool: Eager loading (with() + OptimizedAppointmentQueries trait)
Example: Appointment::withCommonRelations()->get()
```

#### 4.2 Redis Caching Layer
```
Target: -30-50ms
Patterns:
  - company:{id}:user:{id} → 5min TTL
  - company:{id}:phone:{phone} → 1hour TTL
  - availability:{event_type}:{date} → 10min TTL
Invalidation: Event-driven (listeners)
```

#### 4.3 Agent Prompt Optimization
```
Target: -50-100ms (BIGGEST WIN!)
Change: Cleaner name verification in Retell prompt
No re-asking for confirmation if user already provided name
```

### Files to Create/Modify
```
app/Traits/
  └─ OptimizedAppointmentQueries.php (scopes + eager loading)

app/Services/Cache/
  └─ AppointmentCacheService.php (Redis wrapper)

app/Listeners/
  └─ InvalidateAppointmentCache.php (event listener)

config/retell-agent.php
  → Update system prompt

database/migrations/
  └─ Add composite indexes for eager loading
```

### Benchmarking
```bash
# Before optimization
k6 run tests/Performance/k6/baseline-booking-flow.js
# Expected: ~144s P95

# After optimization
k6 run tests/Performance/k6/baseline-booking-flow.js
# Expected: ~42s P95 (3.4x faster)
```

### Success Criteria
- ✅ P95 booking time: <50s (was 144s)
- ✅ Cache hit rate: >80%
- ✅ Database queries: <10 per booking (was 50+)
- ✅ Agent latency: <5s (was ~100s)

### Deployment Strategy
- Staging: Week 5 Monday
- Gradual rollout: 10% → 50% → 100% (monitor metrics)

### Effort Estimate
- 2 days
- 1 developer

---

## 🔵 PHASE 5: SERVICE ARCHITECTURE REFACTOR (Week 5-6)

### Goal
Clean separation of concerns, improved testability, SRP compliance

### Current Problems
```
AppointmentCreationService has 10+ responsibilities:
  ❌ Confidence validation
  ❌ Customer creation/lookup
  ❌ Service resolution
  ❌ Cal.com booking
  ❌ Alternative finding
  ❌ Nested booking
  ❌ Local record creation
  ❌ Staff assignment
  ❌ Notification
  ❌ Lifecycle tracking
```

### Solution: Extract 5 Focused Services
```
BookingOrchestrator (orchestrator)
  ├─ BookingValidationService (validate inputs)
  ├─ CustomerResolutionService (find/create customer)
  ├─ ServiceResolutionService (find correct service)
  ├─ AppointmentPersistenceService (save to DB)
  └─ BookingNotificationService (send confirmations)
```

### Event-Driven Architecture
```
8 Domain Events:
  • AppointmentBookingInitiated
  • AppointmentBooked
  • AppointmentBookingFailed
  • CalcomBookingCreated
  • CalcomSyncRequired
  • WebhookReceived
  • WebhookProcessed
  • InconsistencyDetected

Listeners:
  • SendBookingConfirmationEmail
  • UpdateCustomerEngagementScore
  • LogBookingMetrics
  • NotifyAdminOnSyncFailure
  • InvalidateAppointmentCache
```

### Files to Create
```
app/Services/Appointments/
  ├─ BookingOrchestrator.php
  ├─ BookingValidationService.php
  ├─ CustomerResolutionService.php
  ├─ ServiceResolutionService.php
  └─ AppointmentPersistenceService.php

app/Events/
  ├─ AppointmentBookingInitiated.php
  ├─ AppointmentBooked.php
  ├─ CalcomBookingCreated.php
  └─ (5 more)

app/Listeners/
  ├─ SendBookingConfirmationEmail.php
  ├─ UpdateCustomerEngagementScore.php
  ├─ InvalidateAppointmentCache.php
  └─ (5 more)
```

### Testing Impact
- Unit test coverage: <60% → >80%
- Service tests: Easy to unit test in isolation
- No need for mocks (depends on abstractions)

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Unit test coverage: >80%
- ✅ Each service has single responsibility
- ✅ All side effects via events
- ✅ No tight coupling

### Deployment
- Staging only (careful!)
- Feature flag to switch old → new code
- Gradual traffic migration

### Effort Estimate
- 3 days
- 2 developers

  • Rate limiting
  • Circuit breaker state

Integration Tests (70%+ coverage):
  • Complete booking flow (happy path)

Performance Tests:
  • Baseline: Current (144s)
  • Target: <45s
  • Load: 10-100 concurrent users
  • Stress: Find breaking point

E2E Tests:
  • User journey (booking → confirmation → email)
  • Admin panel (call review, metrics)
  • Error scenarios (network failures)
  • Concurrent bookings

Security Tests:
  • SQL injection attempts
  • Authorization bypass

  • Investigate in sprint
  • Re-enable with fix
```

### Success Criteria

npx playwright test

# Watch CI/CD
git push → GitHub Actions → Monitor dashboard
```

### Effort Estimate
- 3 days
- 1 developer (tests mostly ready)

## 📊 PHASE 7: MONITORING & ALERTING (Week 7-8)

### Goal
Production observability + SLA enforcement

### Components

#### 7.1 Metrics Collection
```
Booking Metrics:
  • Success rate (%)
  • P50/P95/P99 latencies
  • Cache hit/miss rates
  • Circuit breaker state
  • Error rates by type

Performance Metrics:
  • API response time
  • Database query time
  • Cal.com API latency
  • Memory usage
  • CPU usage
```

#### 7.2 Dashboards (Grafana)
```
Dashboard 1: Booking KPIs
  • Success rate (target: >98%)
  • P95 latency (target: <50s)
  • Failure breakdown (by type)
  • Circuit breaker state

Dashboard 2: Performance
  • Query time distribution
  • Cache effectiveness
  • API latencies
  • Throughput (bookings/min)

Dashboard 3: Operational
  • Error rates
  • Sync failures
  • Orphaned bookings
  • System health
```

#### 7.3 Alert Thresholds
```
🔴 CRITICAL (Page on-call):
  • Success rate <90%
  • P95 latency >2s
  • Circuit breaker open >30s
  • Database connection errors

🟡 WARNING (Notify team):
  • Success rate <95%
  • P95 latency >1.5s
  • Cache miss rate >20%
  • Sync failure spike

ℹ️ INFO (Log only):
  • All successful bookings
  • Query performance stats
  • Cache metrics
```

#### 7.4 Runbooks
```
Troubleshooting Guide:
  1. Success rate dropping? → Check Cal.com status + circuit breaker
  2. Latency spike? → Check database load, query times, cache hit rate
  3. Orphaned bookings? → Check sync failure table, run reconciliation
  4. Circuit breaker open? → Cal.com API likely down, check status page
```

### Configuration
```
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'askproai-appointments'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['api.askproai.de:9090']

# alert rules
groups:
  - name: appointments
    rules:
      - alert: BookingSuccessRateLow
        expr: booking_success_rate < 90
        for: 5m
      - alert: CircuitBreakerOpen
        expr: calcom_circuit_breaker_state == "open"
        for: 1m
```

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Real-time visibility into all metrics
- ✅ Alerts reach ops team <1min of issue
- ✅ Clear runbooks for common issues
- ✅ Historical data for trend analysis
- ✅ SLA reporting (uptime %, success rate %)

### Effort Estimate
- 2 days
- 1 developer

## 📚 PHASE 8: DOCUMENTATION & KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER (Week 8)

### Goal
Team enablement, long-term maintainability

### Deliverables

#### 8.1 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
```
ADR-001: Event-Driven Architecture
  Context: Need loose coupling between services
  Decision: Implement event bus with Laravel events
  Consequences: Slightly increased complexity, better scalability
