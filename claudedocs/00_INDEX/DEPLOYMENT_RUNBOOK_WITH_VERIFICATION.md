# üöÄ COMPLETE DEPLOYMENT RUNBOOK WITH VERIFICATION
**For**: Each of 8 phases
**Duration**: ~10 minutes per phase (includes testing)
**Risk**: Low (comprehensive verification)

---

## üìã DEPLOYMENT TEMPLATE (REPEAT FOR EACH PHASE)

### PHASE X: [Phase Name]
**Duration**: [Time estimate]
**Risk Level**: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]
**Rollback Effort**: [EASY/MODERATE/HARD]

---

## ‚úÖ PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

**Before you deploy Phase X:**

- [ ] All code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests passing locally
- [ ] Staging environment tested
- [ ] Team notified of deployment window
- [ ] Rollback plan understood
- [ ] Backup taken (for data-modifying phases)
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards ready

---

## üîÑ DEPLOYMENT PROCEDURE

### Step 1: Code Deployment

```bash
# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Verify branch
git branch -v
# Expected: * main [ahead of origin/main by X commits]

# Check what changed
git log --oneline -5

# For database migration phases:
php artisan migrate

# Clear caches
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear

# Restart queue workers (if needed)
php artisan queue:restart
```

### Step 2: Immediate Health Check

```bash
# Quick API check
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/health | jq .

# Expected output:
# {
#   "status": "ok",
#   "timestamp": "2025-10-18T12:00:00Z"
# }

# Check no immediate errors
tail -20 storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -i error
# Expected: No errors
```

### Step 3: Run Comprehensive Tests

```bash
# Run post-deployment health checks
DEPLOYMENT_PHASE=X bash scripts/post-deployment-check.sh

# This will:
# ‚úÖ Check database connectivity
# ‚úÖ Verify schema integrity
# ‚úÖ Test appointment creation
# ‚úÖ Verify cache operations
# ‚úÖ Check API endpoints
# ‚úÖ Capture screenshots
# ‚úÖ Generate reports
# ‚è±Ô∏è  Takes ~10 minutes
```

### Step 4: Review Test Results

**While tests are running**, monitor logs:

```bash
# In another terminal, watch for errors
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log

# Look for:
# ‚úÖ "Successfully processed..." (good)
# ‚ùå "ERROR\|Exception\|CRITICAL" (bad - stop!)
```

### Step 5: Verify Reports & Screenshots

When tests complete:

```bash
# Display summary
cat storage/reports/phase_X_*/summary.txt

# Expected:
# ‚úÖ 10/10 checks passed
# ‚úÖ Success rate: 100%
# ‚úÖ No critical errors

# View screenshots
echo "Screenshots saved to:"
ls -la storage/screenshots/phase_X_*/

# Open screenshots to verify UI still works
open storage/screenshots/phase_X_*/1_1_login_page.png
open storage/screenshots/phase_X_*/1_2_appointment_form.png

# If all green ‚úÖ, proceed to Step 6
# If any red ‚ùå, jump to ROLLBACK section below
```

### Step 6: Sign Off on Deployment

```bash
# Create deployment log entry
cat >> deployment.log << EOF

# Notify team
echo "‚úÖ Phase X deployment verified successfully!" | \
  mail -s "Deployment: Phase X Complete" team@company.com

# Or post to Slack
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
  --data "{\"text\":\"‚úÖ Phase X deployment complete and verified\"}" \
  $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
```

---

## ‚ùå IF TESTS FAIL (Rollback Procedure)

### Immediate Actions

```bash
# 1. STOP - Don't proceed to next phase
echo "‚ùå Tests failed - stopping deployment"

# 2. Check what failed
grep "FAIL\|ERROR" storage/reports/phase_X_*/summary.txt

# 3. Display errors
cat storage/reports/phase_X_*/phpunit.log | grep -A 5 "FAILED\|Error"

# 4. Check recent logs
tail -100 storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -i error | tail -20
```

### Determine Severity

```bash
# Is it fixable without rollback?
# Option 1: Quick Fix (if clear issue)
# - Fix code locally
# - Re-deploy
# - Run tests again

# Option 2: Rollback (if unclear/complex issue)
# - Revert to previous version
# - Verify old version works
# - Schedule fix for later
```

### Execute Rollback

```bash
# Revert last commit
git revert HEAD~1

# Or, go back to specific tag
git checkout v2.0.1
git push origin main

# Verify rollback
DEPLOYMENT_PHASE=X bash scripts/post-deployment-check.sh

# If old version tests pass:
echo "‚úÖ Rollback successful" >> deployment.log

# If old version also fails:
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Both versions failing - investigate infrastructure" >> deployment.log
```
