# Saga Pattern Testing Guide
**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Phase**: Phase 4: Transaction Boundaries & Saga Pattern
**Status**: ✅ TESTING FRAMEWORK COMPLETE

---

## Overview

Comprehensive testing strategy for saga pattern implementation in appointment creation, synchronization, and compensation flows.

**Key Testing Areas**:
1. Happy path execution (all steps succeed)
2. Compensation triggers (single step failure)
3. Compensation failures (critical errors)
4. Concurrent saga execution (multiple concurrent operations)
5. Retry scenarios (partial failures)
6. Data consistency verification

---

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Successful Appointment Creation Saga

**Steps**:
1. Create customer (atomic via RC5)
2. Create appointment record (DB)
3. Assign staff from Cal.com (optional)

**Expected Outcome**: ✅ Appointment created successfully

**Test Code**:
```php
// tests/Feature/Saga/AppointmentCreationSagaTest.php

public function test_successful_appointment_creation_saga()
{
    $customer = Customer::factory()->create();
    $bookingDetails = [
        'calcom_booking_id' => 'booking_123',
        'calcom_booking_data' => [
            'id' => 'booking_123',
            'hosts' => [['id' => 'host_1', 'name' => 'John Doe']],
        ],
    ];

    $saga = new AppointmentCreationSaga(
        app(AppointmentCreationService::class),
        app(CalcomV2Service::class),
        app(CalcomCompensationService::class),
        app(DatabaseCompensationService::class),
    );

    $appointment = $saga->createAppointment($customer, $bookingDetails);

    $this->assertNotNull($appointment->id);
    $this->assertEquals('booking_123', $appointment->calcom_v2_booking_id);
    $this->assertDatabaseHas('appointments', [
        'id' => $appointment->id,
        'customer_id' => $customer->id,
    ]);
}
```

---

### Scenario 2: Appointment Creation Saga - Local Record Failure

**Trigger**: After Cal.com booking succeeds, DB insert fails

**Expected Outcome**:
- ❌ Saga initiates compensation
- ✅ Cal.com booking is canceled
- ✅ No local record created
- ✅ No orphaned Cal.com bookings

**Test Code**:
```php
public function test_appointment_creation_saga_compensates_on_local_failure()
{
    $customer = Customer::factory()->create();
    $bookingDetails = ['calcom_booking_id' => 'booking_456'];

    // Mock Cal.com to return successful booking
    $this->mock(CalcomV2Service::class, function ($mock) {
        $mock->shouldReceive('createBooking')
            ->andReturn(response()->json(['id' => 'booking_456']));
        $mock->shouldReceive('cancelBooking')
            ->with('booking_456')
            ->andReturn(response()->json(['success' => true]));
    });

    // Mock DB to fail on first insert
    DB::shouldReceive('statement')
        ->andThrow(new QueryException('insert', [], new Exception('Disk full')));

    $saga = new AppointmentCreationSaga(...);

    try {
        $saga->createAppointment($customer, $bookingDetails);
        $this->fail('Should have thrown SagaException');
    } catch (SagaException $e) {
        $this->assertEquals('create_appointment_record', $e->failedStep);
        $this->assertDatabaseMissing('appointments', [
            'calcom_v2_booking_id' => 'booking_456',
        ]);
        // Verify Cal.com booking was canceled
        $this->assertTrue(Log::hasMessage('Compensating: Canceling Cal.com booking'));
    }
}
```

---

### Scenario 3: Sync Saga - Cal.com Update Succeeds, Local Update Fails

**Trigger**: Cal.com API succeeds but local status update fails

**Expected Outcome**:
- ❌ Saga marks appointment as "error" status
- ✅ Appointment NOT deleted (Cal.com state is correct)
- ✅ Will retry on next sync cycle
- ✅ Error message stored for debugging

**Test Code**:
```php
public function test_sync_saga_marks_for_retry_on_local_failure()
{
    $appointment = Appointment::factory()->create([
        'calcom_v2_booking_id' => 'booking_789',
        'calcom_sync_status' => 'pending',
    ]);

    // Mock Cal.com to succeed
    $this->mock(CalcomV2Service::class, function ($mock) {
        $mock->shouldReceive('createBooking')
            ->andReturn(response()->json(['success' => true]));
    });

    // Mock DB update to fail
    DB::shouldReceive('statement')
        ->andThrow(new QueryException('update', [], new Exception('Connection lost')));

    $saga = new AppointmentSyncSaga(...);

    $result = $saga->syncAppointmentToCalcom(
        $appointment,
        'create',
        ['appointment_id' => $appointment->id]
    );

    $this->assertFalse($result['success']);
    $this->assertTrue($result['will_retry']);

    // Verify appointment still exists and is marked for retry
    $this->assertDatabaseHas('appointments', [
        'id' => $appointment->id,
        'calcom_sync_status' => 'error',
    ]);

    // Verify appointment was NOT deleted
    $this->assertNotNull(Appointment::find($appointment->id));
}
```

---

### Scenario 4: Sync Saga - Compensation Itself Fails (Critical)

**Trigger**: Both primary operation AND compensation fail

**Expected Outcome**:
- 🚨 Critical error logged
- ✅ Appointment marked for "manual_review_required"
- ✅ Exception thrown to alert monitoring

**Test Code**:
```php
public function test_sync_saga_critical_error_on_compensation_failure()
{
    $appointment = Appointment::factory()->create([
        'calcom_sync_status' => 'synced',
    ]);

    // Mock Cal.com to succeed (simulating initial success)
    // Then mock revert to fail
    $this->mock(CalcomCompensationService::class, function ($mock) {
        $mock->shouldReceive('restoreBookingMetadata')
            ->andThrow(new Exception('Cal.com API down'));
    });

    $saga = new AppointmentSyncSaga(...);

    try {
        $saga->syncAppointmentToCalcom($appointment, 'reschedule', [...]);
        $this->fail('Should throw SagaCompensationException');
    } catch (SagaCompensationException $e) {
        // Verify critical error was logged
        $this->assertStringContainsString('manual_review_required',
            Log::getLastMessage());

        // Verify appointment is marked for manual review
        $this->assertDatabaseHas('appointments', [
            'id' => $appointment->id,
            'calcom_sync_status' => 'manual_review_required',
        ]);
    }
}
```

---

### Scenario 5: Concurrent Saga Execution

**Trigger**: Two appointments created simultaneously

**Expected Outcome**:
- ✅ Both sagas execute independently
- ✅ No race conditions (pessimistic locks prevent)
- ✅ Both appointments created successfully

**Test Code**:
```php
public function test_concurrent_saga_execution_with_pessimistic_locks()
{
    $customer1 = Customer::factory()->create();
    $customer2 = Customer::factory()->create();

    $saga = new AppointmentCreationSaga(...);

    // Execute two sagas concurrently
    $promise1 = $this->createAsyncPromise(
        fn() => $saga->createAppointment($customer1, ['calcom_booking_id' => 'b1'])
    );
    $promise2 = $this->createAsyncPromise(
        fn() => $saga->createAppointment($customer2, ['calcom_booking_id' => 'b2'])
    );

    $appointment1 = $promise1->wait();
    $appointment2 = $promise2->wait();

    // Verify both created
    $this->assertDatabaseHas('appointments', ['id' => $appointment1->id]);
    $this->assertDatabaseHas('appointments', ['id' => $appointment2->id]);

    // Verify no lockForUpdate timeout errors
    $this->assertStringNotContainsString('Deadlock', Log::getAll());
}
```

---

### Scenario 6: Composite Booking Saga

**Trigger**: Create composite appointment with 2+ segments

**Expected Outcome**:
- ✅ All segments booked in Cal.com (all-or-nothing)
- ✅ Composite appointment created locally
- ❌ If any segment fails: all previous segments canceled

**Test Code**:
```php
public function test_composite_booking_saga_all_or_nothing()
{
    $segments = [
        ['staff_id' => 1, 'starts_at' => now(), 'ends_at' => now()->addHour()],
        ['staff_id' => 2, 'starts_at' => now()->addHour(), 'ends_at' => now()->addHours(2)],
    ];

    // Mock: First segment succeeds, second fails
    $this->mock(CalcomV2Service::class, function ($mock) {
        $mock->shouldReceive('createBooking')
            ->times(2)
            ->andReturnValues([
                response()->json(['id' => 'seg1']),
                response()->json('{"error": "Slot not available"}', 409),
            ]);

        // Should compensate: cancel first booking
        $mock->shouldReceive('cancelBooking')
            ->with('seg1')
            ->andReturn(response()->json(['success' => true]));
    });

    try {
        $this->appointmentService->createCompositeAppointment($segments);
        $this->fail('Should have thrown exception');
    } catch (SagaException $e) {
        // Verify first segment was compensated
        $this->assertTrue(Log::hasMessage('Compensating: Canceling composite segment'));

        // Verify no composite appointment created
        $this->assertDatabaseMissing('appointments', [
            'is_composite' => true,
        ]);
    }
}
```

## Monitoring Integration

### Metrics to Collect
```
- saga.created_total (gauge)
- saga.completed_total (gauge)
- saga.failed_total (gauge)
- saga.compensated_total (gauge)
- saga.compensation_failed_total (gauge - critical)
- saga.execution_duration_ms (histogram)
- saga.compensation_duration_ms (histogram)
- saga.lock_wait_ms (histogram)
```

### Alerts to Configure
```
1. compensation_failed_count > 5/min → PAGE
2. saga_lock_wait > 1s (p95) → WARN
3. saga_failure_rate > 1% → WARN
4. manual_review_required_count > 10 → WARN
```

### Log Patterns
```
- "[saga]" = saga-specific logs
- "❌" = step failure
- "⏮️" = compensation started
- "🚨" = critical error (manual review needed)
- "CRITICAL" = compensation failure (data inconsistency)
```

## Troubleshooting Failed Compensation

**If compensation fails**:

1. **Check logs for saga ID**:
   ```bash
   grep "saga_id: abc123" storage/logs/saga.log
   ```

2. **Verify Cal.com state**:
   ```bash
   # Check if booking still exists in Cal.com
   curl https://api.cal.com/v2/bookings/[booking_id] \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $CALCOM_API_KEY"
   ```

3. **Verify local state**:
   ```sql
   -- Check for orphaned appointments
   SELECT * FROM appointments WHERE calcom_sync_status = 'error';

   -- Check for orphaned bookings
   SELECT * FROM appointments WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
     AND calcom_v2_booking_id IS NOT NULL;
   ```

4. **Manual recovery**:
   - If booking exists in Cal.com but not locally: Delete from Cal.com
   - If appointment exists locally but not in Cal.com: Delete locally
   - If inconsistency: Investigate root cause, then clean up
