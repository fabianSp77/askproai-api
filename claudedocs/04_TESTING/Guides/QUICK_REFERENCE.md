## 📊 What Each Test Suite Does

| Suite | Purpose | When to Run |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Pre-Backfill Validation** | Documents current broken state | Before migration |
| **Migration Tests** | Validates migration logic | Before production run |
| **Post-Backfill Validation** | Verifies fix complete | After migration |
| **Constraint Enforcement** | Prevents future NULL values | After migration |
| **Security Regression** | Ensures isolation works | After migration |
| **Integration** | Tests customer lifecycle | After migration |
| **Performance** | No degradation | After migration |
| **Monitoring** | Ongoing validation | Daily schedule |

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All pre-backfill tests pass
- [ ] Migration tests pass in staging
- [ ] Database backup created
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Zero NULL company_id values
- [ ] All post-backfill tests pass
- [ ] Security tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Validation command healthy

---

## 🚨 Rollback Procedure

```bash
# If migration fails
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1

# Restore from backup
php artisan backup:restore --latest

# Verify rollback
php artisan customers:validate-integrity
```

---

## 📅 Ongoing Monitoring

### Schedule Daily Validation
Add to `app/Console/Kernel.php`:
```php
$schedule->command('customers:validate-integrity --alert-on-failure')
         ->dailyAt('02:00')
         ->emailOutputOnFailure('devops@company.com');
```

---

## 🔧 Factory Usage

```php
// Standard (auto-creates company)
$customer = Customer::factory()->create();

// Explicit company
$customer = Customer::factory()->forCompany($company)->create();

// Test NULL state (testing only)
$data = Customer::factory()->withNullCompany()->makeRaw();
```

## 📈 Expected Results

| Metric | Before Fix | After Fix |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| NULL company_id | 31 customers | 0 customers |
| Invalid references | Unknown | 0 |
| Isolation bypass | YES | NO |
| Test coverage | N/A | 98% |

---

## 🎯 Critical Validations

1. ✅ No NULL company_id in active customers
2. ✅ All company references valid
3. ✅ Customer-appointment alignment
4. ✅ CompanyScope functioning
5. ✅ No data loss
6. ✅ Security isolation working

## 📞 Quick Help

```bash
# List all test methods
php artisan test tests/Feature/DataIntegrity/ --testdox

# Run specific test
php artisan test --filter test_identifies_all_null_company_id_customers

# Generate coverage
php artisan test --coverage-html coverage/

# Check minimum coverage
php artisan test --coverage --min=80
```

## 🔒 Security Checks

After migration, verify:
- [ ] Users see only their company's customers
- [ ] Super admin sees all companies
- [ ] Direct find() respects scope
- [ ] API endpoints scoped correctly
- [ ] Policies enforce boundaries
