# Fix Summary: AICallCenter Page Error

## Problem
**Error**: `Call to undefined method Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder::active()`

The AICallCenter page was trying to use an `active()` scope on the RetellAgent model that didn't exist.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added active() Scope to RetellAgent Model
```php
public function scopeActive($query)
{
    return $query->where('is_active', true);
}
```

### 2. Made getAvailableAgents() More Defensive
Added auth checks to prevent null pointer errors:
```php
if (!auth()->check() || !auth()->user()) {
    return [];
}
```

### 3. Form Initialization
Added `getForms()` method for proper Filament form handling:
```php
protected function getForms(): array
{
    return [
        'form' => $this->makeForm()
            ->schema($this->getFormSchema())
            ->statePath('quickCallData')
            ->model($this->quickCallData),
    ];
}
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Active scope is now available on RetellAgent model
- ✅ Auth checks prevent null pointer exceptions
- ⚠️ Page may still have form initialization issues that need further investigation

## Technical Notes
- RetellAgent has both `active` and `is_active` boolean fields
- The scope uses `is_active` field
- No `priority` column exists in retell_agents table (removed from query)
- All current agents have `is_active = 0` in the database

## Recommendation
The page needs further testing in a development environment to resolve any remaining form initialization issues. The core functionality (active scope) has been fixed.
