# Fix for 500 Error After Sync in Retell Ultimate Control Center

## Problem
After clicking the "Sync Agents" button and getting a successful sync, the page would show a 500 error with the message:
```
Failed to load agents: Undefined variable $retellService
```

## Root Cause
The `loadAgents()` method in `RetellUltimateControlCenter.php` had two issues:

1. **Undefined Variable**: When loading agents from the local database, the `$retellService` variable was not defined, but was still being used in a closure on line 406 (`use ($retellService)`).

2. **Tenant Scope Issue**: The query to load local agents was affected by the global tenant scope, which could cause issues in the Livewire context.

## Solution

### 1. Initialize $retellService Variable
Added initialization of `$retellService = null` at the beginning of the `loadAgents()` method to ensure the variable is always defined.

### 2. Handle Null $retellService in Closure
Modified the code that uses `$retellService` to check if it's null before attempting to use it:
```php
if ($retellService && 
    isset($agent['response_engine']['type']) && 
    $agent['response_engine']['type'] === 'retell-llm' &&
    isset($agent['response_engine']['llm_id'])) {
    // Only try to fetch from API if we have a retell service
    ...
}
```

### 3. Bypass Tenant Scope
Changed the query to use `withoutGlobalScopes()` to avoid tenant scope issues:
```php
$localAgents = \App\Models\RetellAgent::withoutGlobalScopes()
    ->where('company_id', $this->companyId)
    ->get();
```

## Result
- ✅ The 500 error after sync is fixed
- ✅ Agents load successfully from the local database after sync
- ✅ Function counts are displayed correctly from cached data
- ✅ The page no longer crashes when `$retellService` is null

## Testing
After applying these fixes and clearing the cache:
```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
```

The Retell Ultimate Control Center now works correctly:
1. Click "Sync Agents" - agents are synced successfully
2. Page reloads automatically - no 500 error
3. Agents are displayed from local database with all their data
