### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found

1. **File Watcher Service**
   - Not running as a background service
   - Manual indexing works but shows duplicate key errors for help center docs
   - Needs supervisor configuration for automatic monitoring

2. **Missing Database Table**
   - `knowledge_code_snippets` table doesn't exist
   - Causes error in `knowledge:stats` command
   - Non-critical - doesn't affect main functionality

   - Returns 419 (Page Expired) without valid token
   - Expected behavior for security

4. **Duplicate Category Errors**

### üìä Performance Metrics

### üîß Recommendations

1. **Set up Supervisor** for file watcher service:
   ```bash
   [program:knowledge-watcher]
   command=php /var/www/api-gateway/artisan knowledge:watch
   autostart=true
   autorestart=true
   ```

2. **Create missing table** for code snippets:
   ```bash
   php artisan make:migration create_knowledge_code_snippets_table
   ```

3. **Fix duplicate category logic** in the indexer to check existence before creation

4. **Add menu integration** to main navigation if needed

## Conclusion

- Browse documentation by categories and tags
- Search for specific content
- View individual documents with proper formatting
- Navigate through the portal structure

The minor issues found don't affect the core functionality and can be addressed in future updates.
