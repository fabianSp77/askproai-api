⚠️  RALPH AGENT - ACTION REQUIRED ⚠️
=====================================

User Story US-001 is IMPLEMENTED but BLOCKED by file permissions.

QUICK FIX:
----------
Run this command as root or with sudo:
    sudo bash /tmp/apply_n_plus_one_fix.sh

Then continue Ralph iteration normally.

DETAILS:
--------
See: /tmp/US-001-IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE-NEEDS-SUDO.txt

The N+1 query optimization is complete and tested for syntax.
It just needs to be written to disk with elevated permissions.

File to apply: /tmp/MonthlyBillingAggregator_fixed.php
Target: /var/www/api-gateway/app/Services/Billing/MonthlyBillingAggregator.php

After applying, delete this file and let Ralph continue.
