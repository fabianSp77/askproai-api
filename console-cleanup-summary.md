## Error Handling Patterns Used

1. **Error State Management**: Added useState for error messages and displayed using Alert components
2. **Toast Notifications**: Used existing toast libraries (react-toastify, Ant Design message)
3. **Silent Handling**: For non-critical errors like permissions, used comments instead
4. **Alert Dialogs**: For critical errors, kept alert() dialogs

## Files Not Updated

Some files still contain console statements but were not updated as they are:
- Development/debugging tools
- Build scripts
- Test files
- Deprecated files in _deprecated directory

## Recommendations

1. Consider implementing a centralized error logging service that can be toggled for production/development
2. Use environment variables to conditionally enable console logging in development
3. Implement proper error boundaries for all major sections of the application
4. Consider using a toast notification library consistently across all components
