CRITICAL FIXED FILES:
====================

Application Files:
  /var/www/api-gateway/app/Http/Controllers/RetellFunctionCallHandler.php
    Original issue: root:root ownership prevented execution
    Status: ✅ Fixed - now www-data:www-data
    Ownership: www-data:www-data
    Permissions: 0664
    Last modified: 2025-10-24 12:07:38

Bootstrap & Cache:
  /var/www/api-gateway/bootstrap/cache/routes-v7.php (428KB)
    Status: ✅ Fixed - rebuilt with correct ownership
    Ownership: www-data:www-data
    Last modified: 2025-10-24 12:26:58

  /var/www/api-gateway/bootstrap/cache/config.php (56KB)
    Status: ✅ Fixed - rebuilt with correct ownership
    Ownership: www-data:www-data
    Last modified: 2025-10-24 12:26:59

Storage:
  /var/www/api-gateway/storage/logs/laravel.log (55MB)
    Status: ✅ Writable by PHP-FPM
    Ownership: www-data:www-data
    Purpose: Monitor code execution and errors

PHP-FPM Socket:
  /run/php/php8.3-fpm.sock
    Status: ✅ Healthy and accessible
    Permissions: 660 (srw-rw----)
    Last restart: 2025-10-24 12:27:00

================================================================================
VERIFICATION COMMANDS:
=====================

Run automated health check:
  bash /var/www/api-gateway/scripts/deployment-health-check.sh

Verify file ownership is correct:
  stat -c '%U:%G' /var/www/api-gateway/app/Http/Controllers/RetellFunctionCallHandler.php
  # Expected: www-data:www-data

Verify caches are fresh:
  ls -lh /var/www/api-gateway/bootstrap/cache/
  # Should show recent timestamps (after 12:07:38 on 2025-10-24)

Monitor code execution:
  tail -f /var/www/api-gateway/storage/logs/laravel.log

Check PHP-FPM health:
  systemctl status php8.3-fpm
  # Should show "Ready to handle connections"

Verify OPCache status:
  php -i | grep opcache.enable
  # Should show: opcache.enable => On => On

================================================================================
ROOT CAUSES FIXED:
==================

Issue #1: FILE OWNERSHIP MISMATCH (PRIMARY)
  Files were owned by root:root
  PHP-FPM runs as www-data (UID 33)
  www-data couldn't modify cache files
  FIX: chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/api-gateway/{app,bootstrap,storage}
  Status: ✅ FIXED

Issue #2: OPCACHE PERSISTENCE (SECONDARY)
  OPCache cached old bytecode in machine code
  Even PHP-FPM restart didn't clear in-process cache
  FIX: php -r "opcache_reset();" && systemctl restart php8.3-fpm
  Status: ✅ FIXED

Issue #3: BOOTSTRAP CACHE INCONSISTENCY (TERTIARY)
  Bootstrap cache files had mixed ownership
  Laravel couldn't reliably update routes and config
  FIX: php artisan cache:clear && php artisan route:cache
  Status: ✅ FIXED

================================================================================

  3. Update deployment procedures

LONG-TERM:
  1. Implement automated file ownership fixes in deployment
  2. Add pre-deployment verification to CI/CD
  3. Create deployment runbook
  4. Set up continuous health checks
