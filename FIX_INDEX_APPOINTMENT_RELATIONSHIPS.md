## Code Changes Summary

### File 1: app/Filament/Resources/CallResource.php
```
Changes: 4 sections commented out
Lines: 51 insertions, 34 deletions
```

#### Change 1.1: Remove appointmentWishes eager-loading
**Location**: Line 200-203
**What**: Removed `->with('appointmentWishes', ...)`
**Why**: Table doesn't exist in database backup
**Impact**: Cannot load wishes, hidden from table

#### Change 1.2: Remove appointments eager-loading
**Location**: Line 204-207
**What**: Removed `->with('appointments', ...)`
**Why**: call_id foreign key doesn't exist
**Impact**: Cannot load appointments, hidden from table

#### Change 1.3: Disable appointmentWishes status check
**Location**: Line 234-239
**What**: Commented out `} elseif ($record->appointmentWishes()->...)`
**Why**: Would query missing table
**Impact**: Shows '❓ Offen' instead of '⏰ Wunsch'

#### Change 1.4: Disable appointmentWishes wish lookup
**Location**: Line 294-311
**What**: Commented out `$unresolvedWish = $record->appointmentWishes()->...`
**Why**: Would query missing table
**Impact**: Shows '−' instead of wish dates

### File 2: app/Models/Call.php
```
Changes: 1 method wrapped in try-catch
Lines: 3 insertions (just try-catch structure)
```

#### Change 2.1: Wrap appointment accessor in try-catch
**Location**: Line 176-206
**What**: Added try-catch around both relationship load attempts
**Why**: Both relationships use missing foreign keys
**Impact**: Accessor returns null gracefully instead of crashing

---

## What Was Fixed

### Primary Issue
**Error**: `SQLSTATE[42S02]: Table or view not found: 1146 Table 'api_gateway.appointment_wishes' doesn't exist`
**Location**: CallResource::table() modifyQueryUsing() method
**Impact**: /admin/calls page returns 500 error

### Secondary Issues Discovered
1. **appointments.call_id missing**: Can't link calls to appointments
2. **calls.converted_appointment_id missing**: Can't retrieve legacy links

### Tertiary Issue Discovered
5. **Call model accessor crashes**: Every access to `$call->appointment` would fail

## Test Results

### Verification 1: Query Loads
```
✓ Query executed successfully
✓ Loaded 3+ sample records
✓ No SQL errors
```

### Verification 2: Relationships Working
```
✓ customer relationship loads
✓ company relationship loads
✓ branch relationship loads
✓ phoneNumber relationship loads
✗ appointmentWishes skipped (table missing)
✗ appointments skipped (FK missing)
✓ appointment accessor returns null safely
```

### Verification 3: Sample Data
```
Call ID: 102
  Customer: Frau Gesa Großmann B.Eng.
  Company: Demo Company
  Branch: Filiale Charlottenburg
  Appointment: null (safe - no crash)
  Has Appointment: false
```
