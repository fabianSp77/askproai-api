# Cost Tracking Alert System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive cost tracking alert system for AskProAI that monitors prepaid balances, usage patterns, and cost anomalies in real-time.

## Components Implemented

### 1. CostTrackingAlertService (`app/Services/CostTrackingAlertService.php`)
- **Core Features**: 
  - Real-time monitoring of prepaid balances
  - Usage spike detection (200% of average usage)
  - Cost anomaly detection (3x average daily cost)
  - Budget exceeded alerts
  - Zero balance critical alerts
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Caching with 5-minute TTL for usage data
  - Deduplication logic to prevent spam alerts
  - Batch processing for multiple companies
- **Alert Types**:
  - `low_balance`: Triggered at 25%, 10%, 5% of threshold
  - `zero_balance`: Critical alert when balance reaches €0
  - `usage_spike`: When hourly cost exceeds 200% of average
  - `budget_exceeded`: When monthly spend exceeds 80%, 90%, 100%, 110% of budget
  - `cost_anomaly`: When daily cost is 3x average daily cost

### 2. PrepaidBalanceObserver (`app/Observers/PrepaidBalanceObserver.php`)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Observes PrepaidBalance model changes
- **Immediate Triggers**: Triggers cost checks on significant balance changes
- **Cache Management**: Automatically clears related caches
- **Smart Thresholds**: Detects 20%+ balance drops for immediate alerts

### 3. CheckCostAlerts Command (`app/Console/Commands/CheckCostAlerts.php`)
- **Scheduled Execution**: Runs every 30 minutes during business hours, hourly otherwise
- **Company Filtering**: Can check specific company or all companies
- **Dry-run Mode**: Preview alerts without creating them
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and logging

### 4. Email Notifications
- **CostTrackingAlert Mailable** (`app/Mail/CostTrackingAlert.php`)
  - Queue-based delivery with priority based on severity
  - Rich HTML templates with severity-specific styling
  - Mobile-responsive design
- **Email Template** (`resources/views/emails/cost-tracking-alert.blade.php`)
  - Professional design matching AskProAI branding
  - Dynamic content based on alert type
  - Actionable buttons for quick responses
  - Support contact information

### 5. Cost Alerts Dashboard (`/telescope/cost-alerts`)
- **Real-time Metrics**: Live dashboard with auto-refresh
- **Comprehensive Views**: 
  - Alert summary by severity and type
  - Company filtering and search
  - Detailed alert information
- **Interactive Features**:
  - Acknowledge alerts individually or in bulk
  - Filter by severity, status, company
  - Real-time updates via AJAX
- **Controller**: `CostAlertsDashboardController.php` with full REST API

### 6. Database Integration
- **BillingAlert Model**: Enhanced with cost tracking alert types
- **BillingAlertConfig Model**: Extended with new alert type constants
- **Company Model**: Added `billingAlertConfigs()` and `billingAlerts()` relationships
- **Migration**: Creates default configurations for all companies

## System Integration

### Scheduler Integration (Console/Kernel.php)
```php
// Check cost alerts every hour
$schedule->command('cost-alerts:check')
    ->hourly()
    ->withoutOverlapping()
    ->runInBackground()
    ->onOneServer()
    ->appendOutputTo(storage_path('logs/cost-alerts.log'));

// More frequent checks during business hours
$schedule->command('cost-alerts:check')
    ->everyThirtyMinutes()
    ->between('08:00', '18:00')
    ->weekdays()
    ->withoutOverlapping()
    ->runInBackground()
    ->onOneServer()
    ->appendOutputTo(storage_path('logs/cost-alerts.log'));
```

### Service Registration (AppServiceProvider.php)
- CostTrackingAlertService registered as singleton
- PrepaidBalanceObserver automatically observes model changes
- All dependencies properly injected

## Key Features

### Smart Alert Logic
- **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate alerts within 24 hours for same threshold
- **Threshold-based**: Multiple severity levels (info, warning, critical)
- **Context-aware**: Different logic for different alert types
- **Performance-optimized**: Uses caching and efficient queries

### Comprehensive Dashboard
- **Telescope Integration**: Follows Laravel Telescope design patterns
- **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refreshes every 60 seconds
- **Mobile-responsive**: Works on all device types
- **Alpine.js**: Modern reactive frontend without heavy frameworks

### Production-ready Features
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with logging
- **Queue Integration**: Email notifications are queued
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching with automatic invalidation
- **Security**: All routes require authentication
- **Monitoring**: Detailed logging and metrics

## Testing Results

### Command Testing
```bash
# Dry run test
php artisan cost-alerts:check --dry-run
# Company-specific test
php artisan cost-alerts:check --company=1

# Results: Successfully created low balance alert when threshold exceeded
```

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Alert was created successfully
SELECT id, company_id, alert_type, severity, title, created_at 
FROM billing_alerts 
WHERE company_id = 1 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Result: Alert ID 2, low_balance, info severity, created at 2025-08-06 10:29:54
```

## Access Points

### Dashboard Access
- **URL**: `https://api.askproai.de/telescope/cost-alerts`
- **Features**: Real-time monitoring, alert management, statistics

### Command Line
- **Manual Check**: `php artisan cost-alerts:check`
- **Company-specific**: `php artisan cost-alerts:check --company=123`
- **Dry Run**: `php artisan cost-alerts:check --dry-run`

### API Endpoints
- `GET /telescope/cost-alerts/data` - Dashboard data
- `GET /telescope/cost-alerts/alerts` - Paginated alerts list
- `POST /telescope/cost-alerts/{id}/acknowledge` - Acknowledge alert
- `GET /telescope/cost-alerts/statistics` - Cost tracking statistics

## Configuration

### Alert Thresholds (per company)
```php
'low_balance' => [25, 10, 5],        // % of low_balance_threshold
'usage_spike' => 200,                // % of average hourly usage
'cost_anomaly' => 3.0,              // multiplier of average daily cost  
'budget_exceeded' => [80, 90, 100, 110], // % of monthly budget
```

### Default Settings
- **Low Balance**: Alerts at 25%, 10%, 5% of threshold
- **Zero Balance**: Immediate critical alert
- **Usage Spike**: 200% of average hourly usage
- **Cost Anomaly**: 3x average daily cost
- **Budget Exceeded**: 80%, 90%, 100%, 110% of budget
