- Webhook simulation with signatures
- Configurable failures and delays
- Support for all Retell.ai operations

### âœ… Phase 5: Documentation
**Completed Files:**
- Created: `/docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` - Comprehensive testing guide
- Created: `/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md` - Common issues and solutions

**Documentation Covers:**
- Testing strategy (Unit, Integration, E2E, Performance)
- Mock service usage
- Common troubleshooting scenarios
- Debug commands and procedures

### âœ… Phase 6: Deployment Preparation
**Completed Files:**
- Created: `/FINAL_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Complete deployment checklist

**Includes:**

## Remaining Minor Tasks

While all major tasks are complete, these minor items could be addressed post-deployment:

1. **Create MockSmsService** - Only if SMS feature is implemented
2. **Add DatabaseStateVerifier** - Nice-to-have for test assertions
3. **Setup APM (Application Performance Monitoring)** - Post-deployment
4. **Create Grafana dashboard templates** - After metrics collection starts

## Deployment Readiness

âœ… **Code**: All implementation complete and tested
âœ… **Configuration**: Production environment fully configured
âœ… **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides available
âœ… **Testing**: Mock services and test strategies in place
âœ… **Monitoring**: Thresholds and alerts configured

## Next Steps

1. Review and execute `FINAL_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
2. Perform security audit
3. Run load tests in staging
4. Schedule deployment window
5. Execute deployment plan
