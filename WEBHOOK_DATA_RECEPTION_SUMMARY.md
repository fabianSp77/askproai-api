## Key Findings

1. The webhook endpoint is correctly receiving and processing Retell webhooks
2. The signature verification is working properly
3. Call records are being created from webhook data
4. Some appointments have been created from calls (historical data shows 2 successful creations)

## Next Steps

As requested by the user, we have successfully verified that:
- **"die Telefondaten übergeben werden an uns"** ✅
- **"den Eingang der relevanten Daten zu prüfen"** ✅

The webhook integration is ready for real call testing. When a real call is made to +493083793369, the system will:
1. Receive the webhook from Retell
2. Verify the signature
3. Create a call record
4. Process any appointment data if present

## Important Note
The user specifically stated: "Es ist jetzt erst mal nur wichtig den Eingang der relevanten Daten zu prüfen und erst mal diesen ersten Schritt abzuschließen"

This first step is now complete - the system is successfully receiving call data from Retell.
