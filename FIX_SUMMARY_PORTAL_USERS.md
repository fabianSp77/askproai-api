# Fix Summary: BusinessPortalAdmin Page Errors

## Problem 1: portalUsers Relationship
**Error**: `Call to undefined relationship [portalUsers] on model [App\Models\Company]`

### Solution:
Added the missing `portalUsers()` relationship to the Company model:
```php
public function portalUsers(): HasMany
{
    return $this->hasMany(PortalUser::class);
}
```

## Problem 2: getEffectiveBalance() Method
**Error**: `Call to undefined method App\Models\PrepaidBalance::getEffectiveBalance()`

### Root Cause:
The PrepaidBalance model uses an attribute accessor (`getEffectiveBalanceAttribute`), not a regular method.

### Solution:
Changed from:
```php
'effective_balance' => $balance ? $balance->getEffectiveBalance() : 0,
```

To:
```php
'effective_balance' => $balance ? $balance->effective_balance : 0,
```

## Results:
✅ BusinessPortalAdmin page now loads successfully  
✅ Shows correct portal user counts  
✅ Displays effective balance correctly  
✅ No more 500 errors

## Technical Details:
- Model: `App\Models\Company` - Added `portalUsers()` relationship
- Model: `App\Models\PortalUser` - Already had company relationship
- Page: `App\Filament\Admin\Pages\BusinessPortalAdmin` - Fixed method call
- Attribute: `PrepaidBalance::effective_balance` - Uses Laravel accessor pattern
