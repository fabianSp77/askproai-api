# Retell Ultimate Control Center - Data Loading Issues Fix

## Issues Reported
1. Data not loading when Control Center is opened (GitHub #90)
2. Data only appears after clicking Dashboard button again (GitHub #91)
3. Other tabs remain empty on load (GitHub #92)
4. Agents briefly shown for 100ms then disappear
5. Livewire errors: `wire:model="phoneAgentAssignment.+493083793369" property does not exist`

## Root Causes
1. **Missing phoneAgentAssignment property** - The property was referenced in the template but not defined in the PHP class
2. **Livewire serialization issues** - Service instances cannot be serialized
3. **Data not loading on initial mount** - Mount method wasn't properly triggering data load

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Missing Properties
```php
// Phone agent assignments
public array $phoneAgentAssignment = [];

// Modal states
public bool $showAgentEditor = false;
public bool $showPerformanceDashboard = false;
public array $editingAgent = [];
public ?array $performanceAgent = null;
public array $performanceMetrics = [];
public string $performancePeriod = '7d';
```

### 2. Fixed Service Serialization
Refactored to use getter methods instead of storing service instances:
```php
protected function getRetellService(): ?RetellV2Service
{
    if (!$this->retellApiKey) {
        return null;
    }
    return new RetellV2Service($this->retellApiKey);
}
```

### 3. Added wire:init for Initial Load
```blade
<div class="control-center-container" 
     wire:init="loadInitialData"
     x-data="{...}">
```

### 4. Improved Phone Assignment Handling
- Initialize phone assignments in loadInitialData()
- Fixed assignAgentToPhone() to accept null agentId and get from form state
- Simplified wire:click in phones.blade.php

### 5. Added Computed Property for Filtered Agents
```php
#[Computed]
public function filteredAgents(): array
{
    // Filter logic here
}
```

### 6. Enhanced Tab Change Handling
```php
public function changeTab(string $tab): void
{
    $this->activeTab = $tab;
    
    match($tab) {
        'dashboard' => $this->loadMetrics(),
        'agents' => $this->loadAgents(),
        'phones' => $this->loadPhoneNumbers(),
        // etc...
    };
    
    $this->dispatch('tab-changed', ['tab' => $tab]);
}
```

## Result
- ✅ Data loads immediately on page open
- ✅ All tabs load their content properly
- ✅ Phone agent assignments work correctly
- ✅ No more Livewire property errors
- ✅ Smooth tab switching with data persistence

## Technical Details
The main issue was a combination of Livewire lifecycle problems and missing properties. By using `wire:init` for initial load and properly defining all referenced properties, the Control Center now loads and displays data correctly on first access.
