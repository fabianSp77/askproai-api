# Retell AI Version Discrepancy Analysis - Summary

**Analysis Completed:** 2025-10-23
**Scope:** Root cause of version confusion (V15-V17 code vs agent_version 24-25-117-129)
**Status:** RESOLVED - Clear explanation with evidence

---

## The Question

You discovered a discrepancy:
- **Call logs show:** `"agent_version": 24` (and sometimes 25, 117, 129)
- **Code has:** V17 wrapper methods (`checkAvailabilityV17`, `bookAppointmentV17`)
- **Documentation mentions:** V15, V16, V17
- **User comment:** "V24 aktiv, V25 ist draft"

**You asked:** What's the relationship between these numbers?

---

## The Answer

There are **THREE INDEPENDENT VERSION SYSTEMS** running in parallel:

### System 1: Our Code Versions (V15-V17)
- **What:** Internal naming for our backend logic
- **Stored:** Code comments in RetellFunctionCallHandler.php
- **Example:** `/** üöÄ V17: Check Availability Wrapper */`
- **Controlled By:** Us (AskPro dev team)
- **Current Value:** V17
- **Incremented When:** We modify function handlers

### System 2: Retell's agent_version (24, 25, 117, 129...)
- **What:** Automatic counter maintained by Retell.ai
- **Stored:** Sent in every webhook, saved to `calls.agent_version` column
- **Source:** Retell API - incremented automatically
- **Controlled By:** Retell (we don't control this)
- **Current Value:** 129 (as of 2025-10-22)
- **Incremented When:** Agent/flow/prompt is updated in Retell

### System 3: Conversation Flow Version (18, 19...)
- **What:** Retell's internal versioning for flow deployments
- **Stored:** In Retell API responses
- **Controlled By:** Retell (automatic)
- **Current Value:** 18
- **Incremented When:** Conversation flow is deployed

## Key Evidence

### From Code
**File:** `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Http/Controllers/RetellFunctionCallHandler.php`

```php
/**
 * üöÄ V17: Check Availability Wrapper (bestaetigung=false)
 * POST /api/retell/v17/check-availability
 */
public function checkAvailabilityV17(CollectAppointmentRequest $request)
{
    Log::info('üîç V17: Check Availability (bestaetigung=false)', [
        'call_id' => $request->input('call.call_id'),
        'params' => $request->except(['call'])
    ]);

    $request->merge(['bestaetigung' => false]);
    return $this->collectAppointment($request);
}
```

**What This Shows:**
- Code is labeled "V17" (our system)
- Method is `checkAvailabilityV17` (our system)
- Endpoint is `/v17/check-availability` (our system)

### From Database Storage
**File:** `/var/www/api-gateway/app/Services/RetellApiClient.php` (line 241)

```php
'agent_version' => $callData['agent_version'] ?? null,
```

**What This Shows:**
- We extract `agent_version` from Retell's webhook
- We store it in database
- This is Retell's counter (129, 130, etc.), not ours

### From Logs (2025-10-22)
```
[INFO] agent_version: 129
[INFO] üîç V17: Check Availability (bestaetigung=false)
        ‚Üë Retell's counter    ‚Üë Our code version
```

**What This Shows:**
- Single call has BOTH version numbers
- Retell's agent_version: 129
- Our code version: V17
- They operate independently

### From Documentation
**File:** `/var/www/api-gateway/claudedocs/03_API/Retell_AI/V17_DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS_2025-10-22.md`

```
Flow Version: 18
Agent ID: agent_616d645570ae613e421edb98e7
```

**What This Shows:**
- Retell tracks flow deployment version (18)
- This is separate from our V17 code version
- Each flow deployment = new version automatically

## The Confusion Explained

### Why It Looks Confusing

```
User observation:
"Call logs show agent_version 24 but code says V17"

What's happening:
1. Retell sends: { "agent_version": 24 }  ‚Üê Retell's counter
2. Our code says: "V17"                    ‚Üê Our naming
3. They don't match = confusion!

Why they don't match:
- agent_version increments whenever Retell changes ANYTHING
- V17 only increments when WE change our backend code
- Different triggers, different rates, different purpose
```

### The User's Comment: "V24 aktiv, V25 ist draft"

**Most Likely Interpretation:**
- User saw in Retell dashboard: "Agent Version 24" (Retell's counter)
- User saw draft: "Agent Version 25" (next Retell counter)
- NOT referring to our V24 code (we don't have V24)

**Why the Confusion:**
- Agent name contains suffix: `"...V126"`
- User thought: "V24 = our code version 24"
- Actually: "24 = Retell's agent_version counter"

---

## Compatibility Answer

**Question:** Is V17 code compatible with agent_version 24?

**Answer:** **YES - 100% COMPATIBLE**

**Why:**
- V17 code defines endpoints: `/v17/check-availability`, `/v17/book-appointment`
- Conversation flow calls these endpoints via function nodes
- Agent version (24, 25, 129) is just metadata - doesn't affect routing
- The endpoints don't care what agent_version is
- V17 code works with any agent_version (24, 25, 100, 500...)

**Analogy:**
```
V17 Code = Restaurant kitchen (equipment, recipes)
agent_version = Event log entry (what we write down)
The kitchen works regardless of what's in the log
```

## Current Production State (2025-10-23)

```
Our Code Version:            V17
‚îú‚îÄ Endpoint: /api/retell/v17/check-availability
‚îú‚îÄ Endpoint: /api/retell/v17/book-appointment
‚îî‚îÄ Methods: checkAvailabilityV17(), bookAppointmentV17()

Retell's agent_version:      129
‚îú‚îÄ Sent in webhook: { "agent_version": 129 }
‚îú‚îÄ Stored in DB: calls.agent_version = "129"
‚îî‚îÄ Incremented by: Retell automatically

Retell's flow_version:       18
‚îú‚îÄ Current flow: conversation_flow_da76e7c6f3ba
‚îî‚îÄ Incremented by: Each flow deployment

Status: All systems working, V17 compatible with agent_version 129
```

## What This Means for Development

### When Version Numbers Change

```
Scenario 1: You modify RetellFunctionCallHandler.php
‚îî‚îÄ Code version ‚Üí V18
   agent_version ‚Üí stays same (129)
   Flow version ‚Üí stays same (18)

Scenario 2: Someone updates agent prompt in Retell dashboard
‚îî‚îÄ Code version ‚Üí stays V17
   agent_version ‚Üí increments to 130
   Flow version ‚Üí stays 18 (unless flow changed)

Scenario 3: You deploy new conversation flow to Retell
‚îî‚îÄ Code version ‚Üí stays V17
   agent_version ‚Üí increments to 131
   Flow version ‚Üí increments to 19

All three can change at different rates independently.
```

### Version Tracking Best Practice

```
DO:
‚úì Document code changes: "V17 ‚Üí V18 improves error handling"
‚úì Monitor agent_version: Track which Retell version called successfully
‚úì Track flow_version: Useful for rollback capability

DON'T:
‚úó Try to sync version numbers (they won't match)
‚úó Expect agent_version to match your code version
‚úó Wait for agent_version to increment before deploying code
```

## Root Cause of Confusion

### Why This Happened

1. **Agent Name Suffix:** Display name includes `/V126` (documentation)
2. **Similar Numbers:** V17, agent_version 24 ‚Üí look related but aren't
3. **Sparse Documentation:** No clear mapping between systems
4. **Auto-Versioning:** Retell increments agent_version automatically
5. **User Comment:** "V24 aktiv" likely meant agent_version, not code version

### Why It Matters

- Prevents wasted debugging effort
- Clarifies which system is being discussed
- Helps with version tracking and monitoring
- Improves communication between team members

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úì Read VERSION_SYSTEM_QUICK_REFERENCE.md (5 min)
2. ‚úì Share with team (prevents future confusion)
3. ‚úì Bookmark detailed analysis for reference

### Short Term
1. Update project README to document both version systems
2. Add code_version tracking to calls table (optional but helpful)
3. Update deployment docs to clarify which system is being updated

### Long Term
1. Consider renaming our V-system to avoid confusion
   - Option: "APIv2.0", "BackendV17", "AskProV17"
2. Build dashboard showing all three version systems
3. Implement alerts when agent_version stops incrementing

---

## Key Takeaway

**The discrepancy is not a bug - it's expected behavior.**

Three independent version systems exist:
- **V17** = Our code version (what WE control)
- **agent_version 129** = Retell's version (what THEY control)
- **flow_version 18** = Retell's flow version (what THEY control)

They operate independently and that's correct. Your V17 code works perfectly with Retell's agent_version 24, 25, 129, or any other value.
