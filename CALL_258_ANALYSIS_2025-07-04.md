- **Branch**: Krückeberg Servicegruppe Zentrale
- **Customer**: Not linked to a customer record
- **Phone**: +491604366218
- **Status**: completed
- **Duration**: 112 seconds (1:52)

## Call Data Available
✅ Transcript data (available in webhook_data)
✅ Recording URL (available in webhook_data)
✅ Call analysis data
✅ Metadata with customer information
✅ Complete webhook data from Retell.ai

## Potential Issues Found
1. **No Customer Record**: The call is not linked to a customer in the database (customer_id is empty)
2. **No ML Prediction**: No ML prediction analysis has been run on this call
3. **Customer Data in Metadata**: Customer data exists in metadata but not linked to a customer record

## What This Means
The call appears to be properly recorded and has all the essential data (transcript, recording, etc.). The main issue is that it hasn't been fully processed:
- Customer matching/creation might have failed
- ML prediction analysis hasn't been run

## Recommendations
1. Check why customer wasn't created from the phone number +491604366218
2. Run ML prediction analysis on this call
3. Verify the call detail page displays correctly despite missing customer link

## Call Detail Page Status
Based on the recent implementation:
- The page should display correctly with the available data
- Customer name will show as "Unbekannter Anrufer" (Unknown Caller)
- Transcript and audio player should work normally
- ML sentiment analysis will not be available

## Technical Notes
The call has complete webhook data from Retell.ai including:
- Full transcript with timestamps
- Recording URL
- Call analysis
- Customer data (in metadata, not linked to customer record)

This appears to be a data processing issue rather than a display issue.
