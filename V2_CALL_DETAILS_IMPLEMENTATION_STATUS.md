```

### API Testing

- /public/test-send-summary-direct.html
```

### Frontend Testing
- The send summary feature is now working with improved CSRF token handling
- Activities are displayed in real-time
- Download functionality for audio recordings is operational

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: CSRF Token Not Being Passed
**Solution**: Modified `ShowV2.jsx` to:
1. Accept `csrfToken` as a prop
2. Fallback to meta tag and window.Laravel
3. Added better error messaging

### Issue 2: TenantScope Errors
**Solution**: Added company context setting in API methods:
```php
app()->instance('current_company_id', $call->company_id);
```

### Issue 3: Email Constructor Mismatch
**Solution**: Fixed `CallSummaryEmail` constructor call with correct parameter order

## Next Steps

1. **Review GitHub Issue #336**: Check for any additional requirements or issues reported
2. **Add More Activity Types**: Expand the activity tracking system
3. **Implement Assign Functionality**: Complete the user assignment feature
4. **Add Recording Download Tracking**: Log when recordings are downloaded
5. **Performance Optimization**: Consider caching for frequently accessed activities
