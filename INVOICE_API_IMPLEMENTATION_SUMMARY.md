### 4. Integration Points

1. **Automatic Invoice Generation**:
   - Invoices are automatically created when topups succeed
   - PDF is generated using Browsershot
   - Email with PDF attachment is sent to company and user

2. **Stripe Integration**:
   - Fallback to Stripe invoice URLs when local PDF unavailable
   - Stripe invoice ID stored for reference

3. **GoBD Compliance**:
   - PDFs are archived with hash for immutability
   - Proper invoice numbering sequence
   - All required fields for German tax compliance

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks:
1. **React Components** (Task #14):
   - Create invoice list component
   - Add download buttons
   - Implement filtering UI

2. **Monthly Invoice Generation**:
   - Create command: `php artisan invoices:generate-monthly`
   - Schedule in Kernel.php for 1st of each month
   - Aggregate all charges for previous month

3. **Stripe Webhook Configuration**:
   - Handle `invoice.payment_succeeded` events
   - Update local invoice records
   - Sync payment status

### Future Enhancements:
- Invoice search functionality
- Bulk invoice operations
- Invoice templates per company
- Multi-language invoice support
- Credit notes and corrections
