## Deployment Strategy

### Blue-Green Deployment
- Zero-downtime deployment
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Health check verification
- DNS-based switching

### Database Migrations
- Online schema changes
- Backward compatible migrations
- Automatic rollback support
- Data integrity validation

## Known Issues & Mitigations

### 1. Cal.com Rate Limiting
- **Issue**: 60 requests/minute limit
- **Mitigation**: Request queuing and caching implemented

### 2. Retell.ai Webhook Delays
- **Issue**: Occasional 2-3 second delays
- **Mitigation**: Async processing with retry logic

### 3. Test Database Compatibility
- **Issue**: SQLite migration incompatibility
- **Mitigation**: Database-agnostic migrations recommended

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Execute security audit before deployment
2. Run load tests in staging environment
3. Train support team on new features
4. Schedule deployment window

### Post-Deployment
1. Monitor performance metrics closely
2. Collect user feedback
3. Plan SMS integration
4. Implement APM solution
