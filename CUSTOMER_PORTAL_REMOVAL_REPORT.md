# Customer Portal Removal Report
## Date: 2025-08-01

### Summary
The Customer Portal (Issue #464) has been successfully removed from the codebase as requested. All customer self-service functionality has been disabled, leaving only the Business Portal (Issue #465) operational.

### What was removed:
1. **Routes**:
   - `/routes/portal.php` → Renamed to `/routes/portal.php.disabled`
   - `/routes/knowledge.php` → Renamed to `/routes/knowledge.php.disabled`
   - All `/portal/*` routes now redirect to `/business/*` equivalents

2. **Controllers**:
   - `CustomerAuthController.php` → Renamed to `CustomerAuthController.php.disabled`
   - `CustomerDashboardController.php` → Renamed to `CustomerDashboardController.php.disabled`

3. **Views**:
   - `/resources/views/customers/` → Renamed to `/resources/views/customers.disabled/`

4. **Middleware Updates**:
   - Removed `customer` guard handling from `RedirectIfAuthenticated.php`
   - Customer authentication middleware references have been disabled

### What remains:
- **Business Portal** (`/business/*`) - Fully operational for business users
- **Customer Model** - Still exists as it represents business customers (Kunden) in the database
- **Auth Configuration** - Customer guard configuration remains in `config/auth.php` but is unused

### Backup Location:
All removed files have been backed up to:
`/var/www/api-gateway/storage/customer-portal-backup-20250801-135907/`

### Testing URLs:
- Business Portal Login: https://api.askproai.de/business/login
- Business Portal Dashboard: https://api.askproai.de/business/dashboard
- Old Portal URLs (now redirect): https://api.askproai.de/portal/ → https://api.askproai.de/business/

### Next Steps:
1. Monitor for any 404 errors from old customer portal URLs
2. Consider removing customer guard configuration from `config/auth.php` in a future update
3. Remove disabled files after confirming no issues (recommended after 30 days)
