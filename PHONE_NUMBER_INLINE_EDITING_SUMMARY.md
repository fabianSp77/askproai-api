### Technical Implementation

#### Backend Changes (CompanyIntegrationPortal.php)

Added new properties:
```php
// Inline editing fields - Phone numbers
public array $phoneEditStates = [];
public array $phoneNumberValues = [];
public array $phoneActiveStates = [];
public array $phonePrimaryStates = [];
public array $phoneBranchAssignments = [];
```

Added new methods:
- `togglePhoneNumberInput()` - Toggle number editing mode
- `savePhoneNumber()` - Save number with validation
- `togglePhoneActiveState()` - Toggle active/inactive
- `togglePhonePrimary()` - Set/unset primary status
- `togglePhoneBranchInput()` - Toggle branch assignment editing
- `savePhoneBranch()` - Save branch assignment
- `deletePhoneNumber()` - Delete with confirmation

#### Frontend Changes (company-integration-portal.blade.php)

Replaced static table with interactive components:
- Inline input fields with save/cancel buttons
- Toggle switches for active status
- Star buttons for primary status
- Dropdown selects for branch assignment
- Hover-to-show edit buttons

#### CSS Enhancements (company-integration-portal.css)

Added styles for:
- Phone table responsiveness
- Star toggle animations
- Edit icon hover states
- Mobile-friendly card layout for small screens

### User Experience Improvements

1. **No Page Navigation** - Everything happens on the same page
2. **Visual Feedback** - Loading states, success/error notifications
3. **Keyboard Support** - Enter to save, Escape to cancel
4. **Mobile Friendly** - Responsive design with touch-friendly buttons
5. **Intuitive Icons** - Standard icons for edit, save, cancel, delete

### Validation & Safety

1. **Duplicate Prevention** - Checks for existing numbers before saving
2. **Required Fields** - Phone number cannot be empty
3. **Business Rules**:
   - At least one phone number must exist
   - At least one primary number must exist
   - Only one primary number allowed
